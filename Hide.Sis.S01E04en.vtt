00:00:01.984 --> 00:00:03.248
Mangkorn?

00:00:07.896 --> 00:00:10.416
Do you know where your sister’s phone is?

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:12.792
I don’t.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.600
Someone went into the room

00:00:25.632 --> 00:00:26.870
after the incident?

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.968
I don’t know about that.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.024
Our searching team is trying their best

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.248
if you could think of anything,

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.336
I think it would be a great help to the case.

00:01:02.008 --> 00:01:04.768
Hello, I want to report a crime.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.544
About the Bupphachinda case,

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.280
on the night of the incident,

00:01:09.312 --> 00:01:11.740
I saw a man leaving the mansion.

00:01:11.984 --> 00:01:14.040
I reckon he’s someone who lives nearby.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.984
He left holding a
a scissor with blood stains on it.

00:01:23.368 --> 00:01:25.008
Hello, are you Mr. Thana?

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.680
Yes.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.784
We have been given a tip-off.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.800
Please excuse us.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.624
Yes, please come in.

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:43.650
Hold on.

00:01:51.768 --> 00:01:53.770
I have something to tell you.

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.392
This is my sister’s handwriting.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.784
I don’t know where it came from.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.800
YOU’RE NEXT.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.312
But I found it

00:02:13.352 --> 00:02:15.056
when I opened the car’s hood

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.024
on the day my brake fluid leaked.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.024
The thing is

00:02:22.632 --> 00:02:24.630
I think the fact that my brake fluid leaked

00:02:26.368 --> 00:02:28.370
might not be an accident.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.488
Thank you for cooperating.

00:02:34.536 --> 00:02:36.490
It must have been a prank call indeed.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.192
Yes, my pleasure.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:39.600
Please excuse us.

00:02:39.632 --> 00:02:40.632
Sure.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.260
So

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:52.768
Where have you been?

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.072
I went to buy some food.

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.168
What was going on?

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.128
Oh, nothing much.

00:03:03.608 --> 00:03:05.610
Someone called the police and said

00:03:05.648 --> 00:03:07.192
that they saw me leaving the mansion

00:03:07.224 --> 00:03:08.856
on the night Chatfah went missing

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.580
with a pair of scissors with blood stains in my hands.

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:13.370
Yeah?

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.296
And then?

00:03:19.624 --> 00:03:21.620
They couldn’t find it.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.020
So they left.

00:03:26.176 --> 00:03:27.176
Yeah?

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.144
(If you want to lie to someone perfectly, )

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:39.584
Is anything up?

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.260
No.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.624
(Then you might want to start by pretending)

00:03:47.672 --> 00:03:49.180
(that you don’t know how to lie.)

00:04:02.544 --> 00:04:05.432
(The first way to make someone trust you)

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.360
(is to pretend you’re harmless.)

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.032
What are you looking for?

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:19.392
Are you looking for the scissors?

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:23.780
No.

00:04:26.544 --> 00:04:28.540
I respect you for your courage.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.056
But if courage

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.560
is used in the wrong place,

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.256
it would become stupidity.

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.752
If I were to get caught today.

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.168
Do you really think

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.344
I wouldn’t tell the police

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.408
whom I saw that night?

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:02.560
Don’t you forget,

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.304
I have a picture of Nathat.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:09.880
The police

00:05:10.616 --> 00:05:12.620
would obviously believe in proofs more.

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.000
(But trust)

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.544
(could only be given once.)

00:05:19.576 --> 00:05:20.872
But you’re lucky,

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.664
that I’m still having fun with you.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:27.768
But whenever

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.376
I lost my patience,

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:33.552
perhaps that

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.712
might no longer be fun for you.

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.096
(As soon as you got caught, )

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.240
(you’re never getting any chances again.)

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:19.704
Did your sleepwalking condition

00:07:19.736 --> 00:07:21.104
get worse?

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:31.392
Yes, it seems to be getting worse and worse.

00:07:33.424 --> 00:07:36.728
And how do you feel after waking up?

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:40.672
I feel frustrated.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:42.944
I feel like,

00:07:42.952 --> 00:07:45.144
Why is this happening again?

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:48.328
Why does it have to happen

00:07:48.368 --> 00:07:49.904
when I was unconscious?

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:52.550
And…

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:56.896
I feel scared.

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:02.510
I’m scared that what happened in my dreams

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:06.360
would become true.

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:12.376
If you can’t control your stress,

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:15.616
your sleepwalking symptom

00:08:15.632 --> 00:08:17.620
would keep getting worse.

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:28.780
Doctor,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.712
no matter how real the dreams seemed to be,

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:41.968
it doesn't mean that

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:45.160
it would really happen, right?

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:53.624
Are you here to help

00:08:53.656 --> 00:08:55.152
or cause me more trouble?

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:56.736
You told me yourself,

00:08:56.784 --> 00:08:57.576
to let you know

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.580
if I could think of any clues.

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:01.230
Woah!

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:06.950
Before you could realize any clues,

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:09.944
you might slip and forget things here.

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:12.096
I’ve been running in this woods

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:12.910
since I was young.

00:09:12.936 --> 00:09:14.510
It’s got nothing on me.

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:21.580
Did you come out and run when you were young?

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:24.232
I only saw you sitting there drawing alone.

00:09:24.416 --> 00:09:26.016
You didn’t come out to play with anyone.

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:28.656
I like being alone.

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:31.392
I like being alone too.

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:37.112
But I didn’t think you would recognize me.

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:42.272
Of course, I remember you.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.792
How can I forget?

00:10:00.256 --> 00:10:02.260
Khem! Your dad is in bad shape!

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.280
Dad! Are you okay?

00:10:05.312 --> 00:10:06.240
Dad!

00:10:06.288 --> 00:10:07.688
What happened?

00:10:07.728 --> 00:10:08.600
The lock on the door was broken.

00:10:08.632 --> 00:10:10.176
He was stuck inside for hours.

00:10:10.216 --> 00:10:11.280
You’re the guard, how can you not know?

00:10:11.304 --> 00:10:11.664
Go on!

00:10:11.688 --> 00:10:12.440
Let’s take him to the hospital.

00:10:12.472 --> 00:10:14.312
Dad, are you okay?

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.176
Dad!

00:10:16.208 --> 00:10:17.496
Hang in there, sir!

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:21.096
Back then, I was so young

00:10:21.144 --> 00:10:23.240
so I didn’t have any chance to talk to you.

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:26.320
I’m sorry for your loss.

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:30.768
That was such a long time ago.

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:33.536
I have also completely forgotten
how I felt back then.

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:37.540
But my dad felt so guilty about it.

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:38.912
It was an accident

00:10:38.928 --> 00:10:40.488
that no one wanted to happen.

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:43.224
An accident?

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:47.656
How do you know it was an accident?

00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:58.072
Hey, wait for me.

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:01.424
Hey.

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:02.376
Why are you in such a hurry?

00:11:02.392 --> 00:11:03.420
Wait for me!

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:06.872
Hey! Wait for me.

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:10.140
Miss!

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:12.160
Does it hurt?

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:13.704
It’s alright.

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:14.720
I’m fine.

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:17.880
Let’s stop here for today.

00:11:29.384 --> 00:11:30.384
Let’s go back.

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:34.944
Easy there.

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:44.704
It seems like me being here today

00:11:44.728 --> 00:11:46.760
is a burden rather than a help to you.

00:11:49.304 --> 00:11:51.300
At least you tried.

00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:54.136
Your older sisters are weird.

00:11:54.184 --> 00:11:55.936
Their younger sister is missing

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.592
but no one cares to help find her.

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:05.900
Sorry.

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.848
I didn’t mean to condemn your sisters.

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:13.688
Each of them must have things to take care of.

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:18.344
Let me ask you,

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:20.824
about your dad…

00:12:22.192 --> 00:12:23.952
was that not an accident?

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:31.136
I’m sorry for your loss.

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:33.736
As for Khem,

00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:35.792
don’t worry about his school fees,

00:12:35.816 --> 00:12:37.536
the farm will take care of it.

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:44.496
You’re looking down on me too much.

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:45.536
I might be poor

00:12:45.568 --> 00:12:46.872
but I’m not stupid.

00:12:46.896 --> 00:12:49.792
Do you think I don’t know what you’re hiding?

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.224
Why did you bribe them with money

00:12:51.264 --> 00:12:52.824
and stop the police from investigating?

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:53.472
Huh?

00:12:53.488 --> 00:12:54.640
Why did you kill my husband?

00:12:54.672 --> 00:12:55.224
Huh?

00:12:55.248 --> 00:12:57.008
Why did you kill my husband?!

00:12:57.016 --> 00:12:58.016
Madame, calm down!

00:12:58.224 --> 00:13:01.952
I don’t really know. I was so young,

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:03.792
I might have imagined things.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.232
But my dad was trying every way to help.

00:13:07.256 --> 00:13:09.040
Some things are long done.

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.480
I think

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:12.180
you should go back and take some rest.

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:34.560
Miss!

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:38.220
Miss!

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:39.820
Picha!

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:45.056
3 MONTHS EARLIER

00:14:03.768 --> 00:14:04.768
Chom!

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:09.928
When did you come back from Hong Kong?

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:12.064
Since yesterday.

00:14:12.088 --> 00:14:13.136
My job wrapped up early.

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:14.816
So I brought some gifts,

00:14:14.864 --> 00:14:15.864
before they go bad.

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:17.960
By the way,

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:20.360
is Nathat here?

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:26.312
Uh, Nathat is…

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:36.464
Right now, Nathat’s already had a stable job.

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:39.552
He would soon step up as the CEO

00:14:39.576 --> 00:14:41.120
instead of his father.

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:45.528
The two have known each other for a long time.

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:47.560
It’s high time

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:51.328
to ask for Chatfah’s hand.

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.296
Hello, Dad.

00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:56.776
Hello, Grandma.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:58.260
Oh?

00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:00.410
I thought you said you were in Hong Kong.

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.112
My work happened to finish quickly

00:15:02.128 --> 00:15:03.496
so I came back early too.

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:08.656
Are Grandma and Nathat here to visit you, Dad?

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:11.904
Oh, Madame Raewadee is asking for Chatfah’s hand

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:12.920
to marry Nathat.

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:16.776
If the two are really in love

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:19.160
then I have no objections.

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:20.936
But her mother…

00:15:20.968 --> 00:15:22.536
She’s very protective of her daughter.

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:25.728
Especially Chatfah, her favorite.

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:29.928
Unfortunately, she hasn’t returned from America.

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:32.664
Shall we wait for her mother to return?

00:15:32.696 --> 00:15:33.696
We can’t wait.

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:39.112
I want to marry Chatfah as soon as possible.

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:52.460
Chom!

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:54.560
Are you okay?

00:15:56.328 --> 00:15:57.536
What do you think?

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:01.152
When were you guys going to tell me?

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:02.360
If I didn’t come back

00:16:02.392 --> 00:16:03.336
and found out with my own eyes,

00:16:03.368 --> 00:16:04.792
no one would’ve told me anything, right?

00:16:04.816 --> 00:16:05.528
Chom.

00:16:05.568 --> 00:16:06.866
Get back and join the table immediately!

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:08.384
This is not good manners.

00:16:08.408 --> 00:16:09.740
Not good manners?

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:12.320
Do I have to care?

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:14.560
Does anyone care about me?

00:16:14.616 --> 00:16:16.560
Does anyone respect me?

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:18.192
You guys use the opportunity that I’m not in the country

00:16:18.216 --> 00:16:19.832
and discuss it behind my back.

00:16:19.864 --> 00:16:22.040
Chom, I also figured it out

00:16:22.072 --> 00:16:23.072
not long before you did.

00:16:23.088 --> 00:16:25.488
Not long, but you still know it before I do.

00:16:25.504 --> 00:16:27.216
When were you going to tell me?

00:16:27.232 --> 00:16:28.888
During the wedding ceremony?

00:16:28.936 --> 00:16:30.712
Or when their kids go to kindergarten?

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:32.020
Hey!

00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:33.576
How could you do that?

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:36.560
How could you let that bitch Chat
steal Nathat from me?

00:16:36.592 --> 00:16:38.728
You knew that I and Nathat…

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:41.040
What’s with Nathat?

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:45.056
Go on.

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:47.552
You and Nathat what?

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:49.928
Were you guys dating?

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:52.000
Not quite.

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:56.536
What are you trying to do?

00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:58.912
I’m not doing anything

00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:01.696
because you and Nathat are nothing.

00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:05.672
You’re just having a one-sided crush on him.

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:10.560
And a crush is not dating, is it?

00:17:12.816 --> 00:17:14.032
Chom, don’t.

00:17:14.048 --> 00:17:14.720
Come here!

00:17:14.768 --> 00:17:16.448
If you want something

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:18.450
but don’t try to get it,

00:17:18.488 --> 00:17:21.040
that means you don’t want it bad enough.

00:17:30.768 --> 00:17:31.848
From today on,

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:35.784
I don’t have a sister like you.

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.128
All these times,

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:43.008
have you ever thought of me as a sister?

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:08.180
Yes?

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:11.160
Right now?

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:18.656
Chompoo!

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:19.552
Why did you come this way?

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:21.096
I told you to enter from the back.

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:22.648
Why can’t I come this way?

00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:23.496
A lot of press is waiting for you.

00:18:23.528 --> 00:18:25.150
Let’s go. Let’s forget about them.

00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:26.768
Let’s get your makeup done.

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:27.750
Oh! Chompoo!

00:18:27.776 --> 00:18:29.520
Chompoo! Chompoo!

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:32.032
Chompoo, let me ask you about your sister’s case.

00:18:32.072 --> 00:18:33.896
Any updates?

00:18:33.944 --> 00:18:35.984
What do you think about the people

00:18:36.032 --> 00:18:37.264
who thinks you’re involved with your sister’s fiance?

00:18:37.288 --> 00:18:38.232
I’m so sorry,

00:18:38.264 --> 00:18:39.832
this is not the time for an interview.

00:18:39.856 --> 00:18:41.696
Please give us a little more time.

00:18:41.744 --> 00:18:43.136
Please allow her to get ready.

00:18:43.168 --> 00:18:43.584
Excuse me.

00:18:43.616 --> 00:18:43.928
Sorry.

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:45.000
Oh, just a little more.

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:45.984
Just a little.

00:18:46.008 --> 00:18:47.632
How are you feeling?

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:48.296
Chompoo!

00:18:48.328 --> 00:18:49.328
Chompoo!

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:51.320
Thank you.

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:56.360
I think I should leave.

00:18:56.392 --> 00:18:57.880
I don’t want to give an interview about the case.

00:18:57.904 --> 00:18:59.144
No way!

00:18:59.176 --> 00:19:00.696
I don’t want to say this to your face

00:19:00.712 --> 00:19:02.700
but you don’t have any gigs at all now.

00:19:02.744 --> 00:19:04.264
There are only events such as these

00:19:04.296 --> 00:19:06.810
that have been requesting you.

00:19:06.832 --> 00:19:08.520
And I’ve already filtered some out for you.

00:19:08.544 --> 00:19:11.128
I’ve only accepted those who are willing to pay.

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:18.088
But I think it’s a good opportunity though.

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:20.472
So that you can express your condolences publicly.

00:19:20.504 --> 00:19:22.712
Perhaps the hate train on media

00:19:22.728 --> 00:19:24.160
could soften down a little.

00:19:28.632 --> 00:19:30.630
In other words,

00:19:31.208 --> 00:19:33.560
you should make the most out of this time.

00:19:33.704 --> 00:19:35.768
Because without Chatfah’s scandal,

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:37.770
you might not have received so much attention.

00:19:37.808 --> 00:19:40.040
Can we call an opinion that’s not asked for

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:42.296
as being nosy?

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:44.456
I’m just telling the truth.

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:47.840
You should thank Chatfah for disappearing.

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:48.928
Otherwise,

00:19:49.816 --> 00:19:51.896
you wouldn’t have been invited
to this kind of event.

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:53.624
This bitch.

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:56.096
Stop it Sarah,

00:19:56.136 --> 00:19:58.140
you’re snapping at her like a Chihuahua.

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:01.296
I’m just upset with the Thai society today

00:20:01.344 --> 00:20:06.776
that they just invite whoever is under the spotlight.

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:08.296
Without a care

00:20:08.344 --> 00:20:11.648
whether that person might actually be
a suspect in a murder case.

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:15.560
As long as you can pull the media.

00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:25.344
- Oops, sorry!
- What are you doing?!

00:20:25.584 --> 00:20:27.088
I just wanted to clean some stinks.

00:20:27.128 --> 00:20:28.752
I just realized it came from your mouth.

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:29.984
Hey!

00:20:29.992 --> 00:20:30.824
Why?

00:20:30.848 --> 00:20:32.128
Get down there.

00:20:32.168 --> 00:20:33.360
You’re such a talker, huh?

00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:35.144
Do you want to be the next one dead?

00:20:35.168 --> 00:20:37.544
I’m a suspect in a murder case anyway,

00:20:37.576 --> 00:20:39.296
wouldn’t hurt to kill another model, right?

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:39.992
Come on!

00:20:40.008 --> 00:20:41.112
Did you hear that, everyone?

00:20:41.136 --> 00:20:43.110
She threatened to kill me!

00:20:43.144 --> 00:20:44.624
With that filthy mouth,

00:20:44.664 --> 00:20:45.688
even if I don’t kill you,

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:47.456
you’d die soon anyway, Sarah.

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:53.176
But thanks to you,

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.256
you made me realize

00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:56.584
how I should handle it.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:06.552
I admit

00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:07.912
that earlier,

00:21:07.944 --> 00:21:10.328
I couldn’t control my emotions well.

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:13.744
It was because of stress.

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:17.340
Chat,

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:20.944
please come back, Chat.

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:24.928
I really miss you.

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:44.720
Miss.

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:52.224
I…

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:56.368
Did I get hit by a car?

00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:57.936
Just a graze.

00:21:58.520 --> 00:21:59.616
Nothing serious.

00:22:01.496 --> 00:22:03.304
The doctor said you passed out

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:04.784
because you’re surprised.

00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:10.040
And does it still hurt anywhere?

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:13.744
I still don’t know.

00:22:13.768 --> 00:22:15.740
I’m rather dizzy at the moment.

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:17.740
And I…

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:21.552
Forget it.

00:22:22.208 --> 00:22:24.210
I dreamt of something random.

00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:27.210
A dream?

00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:31.600
It’s a dream I haven’t had for a long time.

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:34.080
But it has nothing to do with it.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.576
If you’re doing better,

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:41.728
I hope you could try to recall your memory.

00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:44.176
Anything you could remember

00:22:44.208 --> 00:22:45.328
or do you recognize the face of the driver

00:22:45.352 --> 00:22:47.144
or are you familiar with that car at all.

00:22:48.936 --> 00:22:50.408
Did they not stop the car?

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:51.912
No.

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:53.728
They drove away so fast.

00:22:55.864 --> 00:22:58.072
They probably didn’t think I would have gotten hit.

00:22:58.610 --> 00:22:59.928
No, I don’t think so.

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:02.608
I think there was an intention to run you over.

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:04.704
Intention?

00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:08.544
Based on a lot of things over the past few days,

00:23:09.584 --> 00:23:11.580
I think you’re being targeted.

00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:20.088
(It’s undeniable that)

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:23.392
(the plot of siblings killing each other for legacy)

00:23:23.424 --> 00:23:25.864
(would be the first thing that came to mind.)

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:29.960
(But for me, it’s not like that at all.)

00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:33.840
(I’ve been working to support myself)

00:23:34.656 --> 00:23:36.660
(ever since my parents were still alive.)

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:41.520
(So, to fight over wealth or legacy?)

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:43.536
(I couldn’t care less about that.)

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:46.072
(I can make my own money.)

00:23:47.888 --> 00:23:49.890
(But would the others in my family)

00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:53.890
(sees it the same way?)

00:23:56.260 --> 00:24:01.184
(I’m not in the position to answer that for them.)

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:16.312
Go and warn Chompoo

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:18.856
that saying this to the press

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:22.616
is like throwing shades on your family members.

00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:26.208
I don’t think she was throwing shades at anyone.

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:28.880
I think she was saying it objectively.

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:31.120
Is this how you want it to be?

00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:33.552
Giving interviews separately

00:24:33.576 --> 00:24:35.632
to get the press to be on your side?

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:40.416
These presses are all using us.

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:43.528
They want us to throw shade at each other
just like this.

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:47.464
What are you trying to say, Uncle?

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:50.940
You might not be able to make it out.

00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:53.088
But in no time,

00:24:53.128 --> 00:24:55.448
they will start digging around our family.

00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:57.576
The longer Chatfah is missing,

00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:00.712
the more vulnerable we are.

00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:07.496
Hmm…

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:10.888
So what’s there about our family

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:12.512
to be dug around?

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:15.752
Or do you and Dad

00:25:17.096 --> 00:25:19.040
have something that’s left untold to me?

00:25:25.224 --> 00:25:26.472
Not too long,

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:28.816
and you’ll understand

00:25:28.856 --> 00:25:30.552
what your sisters have done.

00:25:50.112 --> 00:25:51.528
Yes, it’s me, Bua.

00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:54.528
Captain?

00:25:57.470 --> 00:26:00.368
You want to search
the farm and the warehouse?

00:26:01.528 --> 00:26:02.984
I have the court’s order.

00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:07.488
I have my team searching your farm right now.

00:26:08.328 --> 00:26:10.330
I didn’t want to search your farm at first

00:26:10.976 --> 00:26:12.980
but there’s no clue from the woods.

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:15.400
And your farm happens to be next to the woods

00:26:15.448 --> 00:26:16.936
so I hope we can find out more.

00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:20.768
Then please search freely, Captain.

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:24.472
Actually, I don’t come to this farm often.

00:26:24.512 --> 00:26:26.816
Because Uncle Kajorn is in charge of it.

00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:29.312
But if you happen to find anything suspicious,

00:26:29.352 --> 00:26:30.592
please let me know.

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:35.952
Then I’ll search this warehouse first.

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:37.520
Please go ahead.

00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:59.552
What do you normally store here?

00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:01.032
Fertilizers.

00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:08.730
Captain.

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:12.100
We found a pit that has just been covered
at the back of the warehouse.

00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:24.696
This area used to be a pond

00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:27.872
but it has long been covered up.

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:31.440
But the soil seems like it
has been covered up not long ago.

00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:34.024
Does no one know about it?

00:27:34.744 --> 00:27:36.312
I don’t know about that.

00:27:39.336 --> 00:27:40.984
Then please allow us to check.

00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:43.360
Lieutenant,

00:27:43.376 --> 00:27:44.696
bring in the searching tools.

00:27:44.736 --> 00:27:45.736
Yes, sir.

00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:05.296
Thank you

00:28:05.328 --> 00:28:06.760
for driving me all the way here.

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:11.856
I think you should have spent a night at the hospital.

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:14.360
It seems the doctor didn’t want to discharge you just yet.

00:28:14.384 --> 00:28:16.584
I have a lot to do.

00:28:17.150 --> 00:28:19.664
I also don’t want to worry my sister too much.

00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:27.552
It seems like
you suddenly have to take care of me.

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:29.264
I’m sorry.

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:32.384
Why would you apologize?

00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:34.632
I was there with you at the scene.

00:28:34.656 --> 00:28:35.976
Of course, I would have to help.

00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:39.216
Is it a police officer’s duty?

00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:43.816
You could say that.

00:28:44.768 --> 00:28:47.552
But this is beyond your time of duty.

00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:53.280
The medicines are in the back seat.

00:28:53.552 --> 00:28:54.552
Don’t forget.

00:29:10.728 --> 00:29:11.728
Here you go.

00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:13.896
Thank you.

00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:03.056
Are you trying to flirt with the Captain?

00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:07.744
Using your body to get off the hook, huh?

00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:11.464
What are you saying, Chom?

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.552
I had an accident

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:18.800
so the Captain took me home.

00:30:19.336 --> 00:30:20.752
An accident?

00:30:20.776 --> 00:30:22.512
Any bad injuries?

00:30:25.670 --> 00:30:27.576
No, I don't have any serious injuries.

00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:30.456
It’s a long story.

00:30:30.504 --> 00:30:31.920
I’ll fill you in later.

00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:36.296
I don't think that's what I see in the car.

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:39.320
And what are you doing?

00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:41.560
Do you think I can’t tell?

00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:44.240
Saying that to the press

00:30:44.288 --> 00:30:46.720
is like throwing shades at your family.

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:54.408
What’s your true color like exactly?

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:55.440
Picha.

00:30:57.590 --> 00:31:00.288
At least I didn’t do what you thought I did.

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:13.944
I’m sorry.

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:17.048
Ever since Chat’s gone,

00:31:17.096 --> 00:31:20.160
I feel like I haven’t been myself.

00:31:25.048 --> 00:31:27.050
I feel like I can’t trust anyone.

00:31:31.784 --> 00:31:33.416
But among all the people,

00:31:34.344 --> 00:31:36.340
I trust you two the most.

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:39.568
Of course.

00:31:39.616 --> 00:31:41.248
Because we’re sisters.

00:31:50.910 --> 00:31:52.768
Where the hell had Chat gone?

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:56.752
Can you freaking calm down?

00:31:57.870 --> 00:31:59.648
The police are coming.

00:31:59.688 --> 00:32:01.680
They will help us find her.

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:07.440
But in this incident,

00:32:08.376 --> 00:32:10.380
there are only the 3 of us.

00:32:13.144 --> 00:32:14.336
We might

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:17.064
become a suspect.

00:32:17.096 --> 00:32:18.096
What?

00:32:18.530 --> 00:32:19.872
A fucking suspect?

00:32:19.904 --> 00:32:22.256
The 3 of us didn’t even know
what the fuck was going on.

00:32:22.288 --> 00:32:24.560
It’s because there are just us 3

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:27.864
who saw her falling down and went missing.

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:30.576
Don’t you think it’s weird

00:32:30.624 --> 00:32:33.592
if we tell people that we don’t know
where our sister go?

00:32:33.808 --> 00:32:35.280
Who would ever believe that?

00:32:36.050 --> 00:32:38.496
But the 3 of us don’t know shit!

00:32:38.536 --> 00:32:40.152
Chom!

00:32:40.192 --> 00:32:41.976
Who would ever believe that?

00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:44.696
Use your head!

00:32:45.984 --> 00:32:47.980
Today is when the will is revealed

00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:50.832
and Chatfah’s the only one
who gets the entire legacy.

00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:53.944
It’s also the day she fell down and disappeared

00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:56.864
and during the incident,

00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:00.224
there are only the 3 of us.

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:08.360
Do you guys trust me?

00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:13.060
No.

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:15.536
We have to trust each other.

00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:18.496
If we trust each other,

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:23.920
we have to mention each other’s name.

00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:27.744
So all of us are suspects.

00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:31.064
What?

00:33:31.096 --> 00:33:32.904
What are you saying?

00:33:32.936 --> 00:33:35.280
Why don’t we just tell them the truth
that we’re not a damn suspect?

00:33:35.304 --> 00:33:37.000
We can’t do that, Chompoo.

00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:39.040
If we do that,

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:40.384
people would think we conspired in a lie,

00:33:40.408 --> 00:33:41.408
right?

00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:51.576
But under one condition.

00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:55.464
No one shall betray

00:33:56.808 --> 00:33:58.810
or give any other answers at all costs.

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:05.872
Who do you think

00:34:06.170 --> 00:34:07.864
is the suspect?

00:34:08.410 --> 00:34:09.410
Bua.

00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:11.768
Chompoo.

00:34:13.390 --> 00:34:14.480
Picha.

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:17.200
I’d admit,

00:34:17.248 --> 00:34:18.744
from what happened to Dad and Mom

00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:20.136
to the thing about Chat,

00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:23.496
our relationship has gotten so much worse.

00:34:23.528 --> 00:34:25.152
Hasn’t it been bad from the start?

00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:29.376
And I don’t want it to be that way anymore.

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:35.112
Because we’re now being attacked socially,

00:34:35.144 --> 00:34:36.360
by the press,

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:40.792
and we can’t even trust
someone from our family, like Uncle Kajorn.

00:34:41.728 --> 00:34:43.730
That’s not a surprise.

00:34:43.776 --> 00:34:46.392
Even his wife left him for other guys.

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:49.840
Just like what Mom used to say.

00:34:50.150 --> 00:34:52.280
That Uncle Kajorn doesn’t mean well for us.

00:34:52.584 --> 00:34:53.584
Yeah.

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:02.360
From now on,

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:05.568
we have to trust in each other
as much as we can.

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:13.648
Chompoo.

00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:18.712
I understand why you gave that interview.

00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:22.520
But if there’s a next time,

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:23.952
come and consult me first.

00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:27.870
Okay.

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:31.960
Pi.

00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:35.580
The accident you told us

00:35:36.456 --> 00:35:38.460
does sound a bit odd.

00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:41.440
But if anything like this ever happens again,

00:35:41.472 --> 00:35:43.160
you have to let me know right away.

00:35:47.090 --> 00:35:48.200
From now on,

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:52.080
let’s not keep secrets from each other.

00:36:04.350 --> 00:36:07.152
Since we’re not going to keep secrets,

00:36:08.810 --> 00:36:10.256
I have something to tell you.

00:36:26.384 --> 00:36:28.380
I went to Chatfah’s condo

00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:31.152
and found many things.

00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:36.368
That she sent a sketch of my product

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:38.256
to the competitor’s companies

00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:40.260
in trade for a brand’s ambassador title.

00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:49.328
Damn.

00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:51.864
Seriously?

00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:00.232
More importantly,

00:37:00.656 --> 00:37:02.192
I found this.

00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:10.328
On the day Chatfah disappeared,

00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:13.168
Chatfah has an appointment
with someone called Mangkorn.

00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:15.130
Who’s that?

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:18.712
I don’t know either.

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:20.944
But if I were to guess,

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.616
I think he’s one of Chatfah’s men.

00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:26.800
So pretty, huh?

00:37:26.824 --> 00:37:28.120
So many men.

00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:29.648
But these days

00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:32.584
why would she take notes on a book?

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:34.936
Wouldn’t someone like Chat

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:36.520
note it down in her phone?

00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:37.740
Yeah.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.728
I don’t know about that either.

00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:44.056
But look, in this notebook,

00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:46.060
there are only the appointments with Mangkorn

00:37:46.096 --> 00:37:47.632
and no one else.

00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:51.192
MEET MANGKORN

00:37:51.208 --> 00:37:52.328
MEET MANGKORN

00:37:52.368 --> 00:37:53.616
MEET MANGKORN

00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:55.940
Could it be that…

00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:00.216
Chat’s hiding something from us?

00:38:15.584 --> 00:38:16.712
Bua.

00:38:16.736 --> 00:38:17.736
Yeah?

00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:20.352
Are you really not going to stay over?

00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:23.272
So we can talk before we go to bed
like when we were young.

00:38:24.504 --> 00:38:26.500
I have a meeting in the morning tomorrow.

00:38:26.528 --> 00:38:27.888
I have to go.

00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:29.624
I’ll come again.

00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:32.980
What about you?

00:38:33.090 --> 00:38:34.488
Are you really not going to go back?

00:38:34.512 --> 00:38:36.496
No, I’ll just stay the night here.

00:38:36.544 --> 00:38:37.592
You go ahead.

00:38:39.590 --> 00:38:40.590
I’ll get going.

00:38:41.210 --> 00:38:42.288
Bua.

00:38:47.730 --> 00:38:49.176
Thank you so much.

00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:52.120
Thank you for everything.

00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:55.650
Yeah.

00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:57.344
No problem.

00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:00.432
But from now on,

00:39:00.472 --> 00:39:03.072
we must trust each other more.

00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:05.640
Because we’re all we have left.

00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:14.920
(Trust is strange.)

00:39:16.210 --> 00:39:18.360
(It’s hard to build.)

00:39:22.088 --> 00:39:22.784
Go!

00:39:22.824 --> 00:39:23.824
This is getting cheesy.

00:39:24.136 --> 00:39:25.736
You’re giving me goosebumps.

00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:26.800
Okay.

00:39:26.848 --> 00:39:28.160
Then see you.

00:39:28.650 --> 00:39:29.824
Get home safe.

00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:33.216
Chom.

00:39:33.248 --> 00:39:34.248
Yeah?

00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:36.848
I’m actually not going to spend the night here.

00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:38.270
What?

00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:41.240
You have the keycard to Chat’s room, right?

00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:46.272
(But can be destroyed so easily.)

00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:02.376
Mangkorn?

00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:13.030
You’re the one who killed Chatfah, right?

00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:15.030
Pardon?

00:40:15.690 --> 00:40:17.456
You’re the one who killed Chatfah, right?

00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:36.960
(To keep the ties intact, )

00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:41.976
EXAMINATION RESULT CERTIFICATE
CHATFAH BUPPHACHINDA

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.256
(is to hide)

00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:48.272
NON-PREGNANCY.

00:40:48.296 --> 00:40:49.120
(the secret away.)

00:40:49.144 --> 00:40:50.696
(As deep as possible.)

00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:53.288
I knew it.

00:41:10.490 --> 00:41:14.050
SHARE TRANSFER AGREEMENT
TRANSFEROR: CHATFAH BUPPHACHINDA
RECEIVER: BUNTHARIKA BUPPHACHINDA

00:41:17.950 --> 00:41:20.368
If any of you think it’s unfair,

00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:22.816
and you want me to give anything back,

00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:23.960
I’ll do so.

00:41:24.184 --> 00:41:26.360
This company will never be yours anyway.

00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:29.328
What if I ask Chat to sell me her share,

00:41:30.010 --> 00:41:31.560
the tables might turn.

00:41:31.584 --> 00:41:36.144
CHATFAH BUPPHACHINDA: TRANSFEROR
BUNTHARIKA BUPPHACHINDA: RECEIVER

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.512
When are you leaving the country?

00:41:48.416 --> 00:41:49.768
Probably tonight.

00:41:50.490 --> 00:41:52.752
You’re not hurt anywhere, right?

00:41:53.250 --> 00:41:55.440
I’m sorry, I went too hard on the accelerator.

00:41:55.464 --> 00:41:56.528
I was careless.

00:41:59.696 --> 00:42:01.700
(Because if no one knows, )

00:42:02.728 --> 00:42:04.744
(then no one would have to face the pain.)

00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:08.072
If you manage to get off the hook of being a suspect.

00:42:08.104 --> 00:42:11.128
Then you would get lots of legacy, right?

00:42:11.176 --> 00:42:12.152
You even went so far as

00:42:12.176 --> 00:42:13.672
cutting the brake fluid line.

00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:22.048
This money I got

00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:24.920
is a bit too little, Miss Picha.

00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:36.328
Never mention this again.

00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:37.888
Hurry up and go.

00:42:39.490 --> 00:42:42.408
(Even if it turns you into a monster.)

00:42:49.810 --> 00:42:51.544
Don’t you think Chom would be hurt

00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:53.216
if she knows the truth?

00:42:53.256 --> 00:42:54.752
You betrayed me.

00:42:56.648 --> 00:42:59.216
Is this what you do to your sister?

00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:03.472
Sneaking into our farm to dig a pit in our land?

00:43:03.504 --> 00:43:04.640
You found it?

00:43:05.096 --> 00:43:07.100
Don’t tell me that this is Chatfah.

00:43:07.136 --> 00:43:08.632
You liked Chat all along, right?

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.776
Think of me as Chat.
