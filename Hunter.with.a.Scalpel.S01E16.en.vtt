00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.447
Older brother?

00:01:33.433 --> 00:01:34.475
YOON SE EUN

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:42.353
Right, that's how it does it.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.400
When it's finished...

00:01:45.272 --> 00:01:48.191
...put your hands together like this
and close your eyes.

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.503
Then say goodbye from the heart.

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.122
Goodbye.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.123
Goodbye.

LAST EPISODE

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:18.864
Unlucky.

00:03:19.161 --> 00:03:21.995
This is literally an autopsy room.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.093
He brought his equipment too.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.350
Call the joint team and
ask to check it directly.

00:03:32.565 --> 00:03:33.632
Yes, I understand.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.967
Se-eun.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.431
Father...

00:04:38.751 --> 00:04:40.866
Dad loves you very much.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:52.956
You've arrived.

00:04:54.857 --> 00:04:56.194
Have you been waiting long?

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.194
This place hasn't changed.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.733
Looks like it's there?

00:05:02.125 --> 00:05:03.960
The place where we buried Jung-mi.

00:05:11.572 --> 00:05:12.405
Yes.

00:05:12.947 --> 00:05:14.514
Yoon Jo-kyun's box car has been found.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.347
But there is no Se-eun here.

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.033
Save me.

00:05:24.163 --> 00:05:25.765
Please save me.

00:05:48.947 --> 00:05:50.572
It's not an ordinary clock.

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:52.958
But special hours...

00:05:54.063 --> 00:05:57.004
...who can call someone
when you need it.

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:13.786
Se-eun...

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.847
...you killed?

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.926
Is he that important?

00:06:26.079 --> 00:06:28.240
The sea breeze felt very cold.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:33.130
Let's go, Dad has prepared the boat.
and we start a new beginning.

00:06:34.326 --> 00:06:35.333
Why should I come?

00:06:35.998 --> 00:06:38.385
There are police everywhere because of you.

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.524
Not because of me, but you.

00:06:40.908 --> 00:06:41.741
And you?

00:06:42.655 --> 00:06:44.248
What's the difference with you?

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.153
Is it just because of you?
talk on television broadcast...

00:06:49.429 --> 00:06:54.392
...you think they will
believe and understand what you say?

00:06:55.209 --> 00:06:59.678
Who is with you?
when you pry...

00:07:00.212 --> 00:07:03.279
...picking, sewing, and cutting it?

00:07:03.751 --> 00:07:04.861
That damn detective?

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.591
Or your crazy mother?

00:07:09.408 --> 00:07:10.438
I.

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:12.493
Only me!

00:07:14.901 --> 00:07:16.053
The one by your side.

00:07:16.558 --> 00:07:17.504
You are special.

00:07:18.583 --> 00:07:20.537
You are different from other humans.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.733
Only Father can
understand your specialness.

00:07:24.252 --> 00:07:25.483
Who loves you.

00:07:26.315 --> 00:07:28.358
Who do you think is left by your side?

00:07:29.319 --> 00:07:30.280
Eventually...

00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:34.458
...only me.

00:07:38.615 --> 00:07:39.561
Understand me?

00:07:43.904 --> 00:07:44.737
Love me?

00:07:46.106 --> 00:07:47.356
More than that.

00:07:53.741 --> 00:07:54.976
It hurts a lot, right?

00:07:58.022 --> 00:08:00.336
Is Doctor Seo's location known?

00:08:00.383 --> 00:08:03.243
We can only confirm
he exited the Mujin toll gate...

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:07.525
...and got a report from a ship owner
around Mujin who was found murdered.

00:08:07.901 --> 00:08:09.649
Estimated to have died an hour ago.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:14.017
We got a recording of the call on his phone.
If Yoon Jo-kyun orders two seats...

00:08:14.042 --> 00:08:16.556
...and we are asking
Haean police assistance.

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:20.833
If so, from the start
he doesn't care about Se-eun.

00:08:21.206 --> 00:08:22.420
Most likely so.

00:08:22.553 --> 00:08:24.551
If there wasn't that kid in the box car...

00:08:24.863 --> 00:08:26.756
...Jo-kyun for sure
throw it around there.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.966
I leave the search to you
your team and you join here directly.

00:08:30.107 --> 00:08:31.760
I have to go.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.188
If I don't go, proof or...

00:08:34.617 --> 00:08:37.179
...Se-eun's body will never be found.

00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:39.258
Chairman Jung, did you hear me?

00:08:46.915 --> 00:08:48.961
There is a big button
on the right, right?

00:08:49.535 --> 00:08:52.135
Another button will appear
if you press it.

00:08:52.714 --> 00:08:56.480
Then someone will come to help you.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:06.321
HELP 112

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.860
HELP 112

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.602
Help me.

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:22.196
Help.

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.273
Chairman Jung?

00:09:27.557 --> 00:09:28.392
Wait a moment.

00:09:28.818 --> 00:09:29.365
HELP
MESSAGE FROM SEO SE-HYUN

00:09:29.396 --> 00:09:32.407
You are not using
the hour I gave.

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.805
I gave it to the child.

00:09:34.873 --> 00:09:38.951
He might need it because
have a lot of similarities with me.

00:09:39.061 --> 00:09:41.606
HELP
MESSAGE FROM SEO SE-HYUN

00:09:46.475 --> 00:09:47.308
Chairman Hong.

00:09:48.015 --> 00:09:49.211
Se-eun's location has been found.

00:09:50.111 --> 00:09:53.688
I will go help the child.
and you help Doctor Seo.

00:09:54.133 --> 00:09:54.836
Yes.

00:09:55.272 --> 00:09:56.105
Let's go.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.307
HARD DRUGS

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:02.618
If I had done this before...

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:10.688
...Sister Eun-seo and Se-eun won't die.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.297
Don't joke around and give that thing.

00:10:12.322 --> 00:10:13.071
Father.

00:10:17.895 --> 00:10:18.790
Goodbye.

00:10:20.545 --> 00:10:21.378
Se-eun.

00:10:26.991 --> 00:10:27.824
Se-eun?

00:10:28.543 --> 00:10:29.376
Se-eun.

00:10:30.751 --> 00:10:31.584
Se-eun.

00:10:32.125 --> 00:10:32.965
Hey!

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:36.808
Never ever...

00:10:37.892 --> 00:10:39.737
...We meet again.

00:10:42.926 --> 00:10:43.759
No.

00:10:47.401 --> 00:10:48.539
Se-eun!

00:10:48.844 --> 00:10:50.177
Se-eun.

00:10:50.271 --> 00:10:51.271
Se-eun!

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:52.713
Se-eun.

00:10:53.993 --> 00:10:55.282
Se-eun!

00:10:55.623 --> 00:10:56.456
Se-eun!

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:57.560
Se-eun!

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.508
Se-eun, where are you?

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.305
Se-eun!

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:15.446
Se-eun!

00:11:16.287 --> 00:11:17.329
Se-eun!

00:11:18.615 --> 00:11:19.911
Se-eun!

00:11:19.936 --> 00:11:20.769
Se-eun!

00:11:20.845 --> 00:11:22.633
Se-eun, where are you?

00:11:22.658 --> 00:11:24.886
Damn, where is he actually?

00:11:25.168 --> 00:11:26.001
Se-eun!

00:11:26.884 --> 00:11:28.136
Se-eun, did you hear?

00:11:28.457 --> 00:11:29.290
Se-eun!

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:32.873
Yoon Se...

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:54.477
Se-eun!

00:12:23.426 --> 00:12:24.259
No.

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:33.527
Senior Chang Jin.

00:12:35.303 --> 00:12:36.273
Senior Jeon!

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.961
He's still moving.

00:12:58.016 --> 00:12:58.849
Se-eun?

00:12:59.438 --> 00:13:00.808
Did you hear Uncle's voice?

00:13:02.334 --> 00:13:03.344
I...

00:13:05.045 --> 00:13:06.420
...Brother Se-hyun's friend.

00:13:07.186 --> 00:13:08.461
You know him, right?

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:16.349
Brother Se-hyun...

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.543
...asking me to save you.

00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:23.076
Therefore, you must not sleep.

00:13:53.135 --> 00:13:54.458
Do you think...

00:13:55.466 --> 00:13:57.461
...I will die before you?

00:14:30.359 --> 00:14:31.702
Don't worry.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:37.461
I don't inject drugs
with the dose you use.

00:14:38.407 --> 00:14:39.704
Still many...

00:14:41.129 --> 00:14:42.868
...what I want to do.

00:14:43.166 --> 00:14:44.462
From now on...

00:14:45.056 --> 00:14:49.766
...I will cut open your stomach with
the way you taught me.

00:14:50.606 --> 00:14:53.260
Cut open your stomach and
take out all your organs.

00:14:54.112 --> 00:14:59.547
Then the eyeballs,
tongue, and finally the skin membrane.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.110
The order is correct, right?

00:15:11.171 --> 00:15:12.368
Do you hear my voice?

00:15:33.043 --> 00:15:34.230
Seo Se Hyun!

00:15:35.509 --> 00:15:36.946
Seo Se-hyun, don't do that!

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:39.813
Seo Se Hyun!

00:15:42.942 --> 00:15:44.192
Se-eun, congratulations!

00:15:45.385 --> 00:15:46.807
Chairman Jung found it!

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:48.520
Take it easy!

00:15:49.597 --> 00:15:50.765
Se-eun is still alive.

00:15:51.518 --> 00:15:52.681
Se-eun is still alive.

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:04.954
Thank you for having
let Se-eun live.

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:10.586
If there's something I want to be proud of...

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.711
...I will meet you with Se-eun.

00:16:14.437 --> 00:16:15.400
Because of that...

00:16:17.073 --> 00:16:19.720
...which made Father suffer the most.

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:41.998
It's a muscle relaxant.

00:16:42.333 --> 00:16:44.571
It is not life threatening.

00:17:37.471 --> 00:17:39.431
Known cases
as The Tailor Case...

00:17:39.456 --> 00:17:42.375
...and had caused a stir
country for the last 24 days...

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.498
...with Seo Se-hyun and
Yoon Jo-kyun as a suspect...

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:47.458
...the Yongcheon serial murders
finally managed to be caught.

00:17:47.483 --> 00:17:52.082
Suspect Yoon Jo-kyun was found in
injured state after a dispute...

00:17:52.245 --> 00:17:56.557
...with another suspect Seo Se-hyun
and immediately taken to the hospital.

00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:01.602
A ten year old girl who
become a victim and be held hostage by the suspect...

00:18:01.778 --> 00:18:03.537
He deceived everyone.

00:18:03.786 --> 00:18:06.227
That woman is the real perpetrator.

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:11.674
This is the second time Mr. Choi
become the woman's target.

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:16.070
The woman who bestows
all to Mr. Choi!

00:18:23.403 --> 00:18:27.078
It's so nice to meet you again.

00:18:30.301 --> 00:18:31.483
What's the matter...

00:18:33.874 --> 00:18:38.688
...didn't tell us if we could
message from Yoon Jo-kyun and go alone?

00:18:38.966 --> 00:18:42.306
Even though we can
discuss it together.

00:18:42.673 --> 00:18:45.196
I have decided
since seeing Se-eun's uniform.

00:18:46.469 --> 00:18:50.907
I will end the circle
this devil with my own hands.

00:18:51.719 --> 00:18:52.620
In that case...

00:18:55.485 --> 00:18:56.852
...do you really want to kill him?

00:18:57.179 --> 00:18:57.920
Yes.

00:18:58.834 --> 00:19:01.883
Kill him and me too.

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:07.594
This time, I really...

00:19:09.948 --> 00:19:11.617
...want it all to end.

00:19:18.672 --> 00:19:19.765
How is Se-eun?

00:19:22.331 --> 00:19:23.736
He is fine?

00:19:26.844 --> 00:19:27.677
Yes.

00:19:28.783 --> 00:19:30.362
He recovered quickly.

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:32.660
He also ate with gusto.

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:37.920
From the results of the investigation...

00:19:39.255 --> 00:19:43.971
...all Yongcheon cases
It is known that it was Yoon Jo-kyun's doing.

00:19:44.266 --> 00:19:45.099
But...

00:19:46.212 --> 00:19:50.132
You should be tried for forgery
National Forensic Agency report results...

00:19:50.562 --> 00:19:55.830
...Kwon Hyung-jo's case, and left
without permission while in the hospital.

00:19:57.298 --> 00:19:59.245
Not including attempted murder apparently.

00:19:59.569 --> 00:20:00.471
About that...

00:20:00.958 --> 00:20:04.546
...actually because it can
considered as self-defense...

00:20:04.718 --> 00:20:06.072
Even though...

00:20:07.166 --> 00:20:10.690
...the fact that I am very
want to kill that man...

00:20:13.982 --> 00:20:15.627
...is not lost.

00:20:29.251 --> 00:20:30.674
Don't worry too much.

00:20:31.651 --> 00:20:33.600
That could be considered self-defense.

00:20:36.062 --> 00:20:37.932
Thank you, Chairman Jung.

00:20:40.391 --> 00:20:42.080
Thanks to your consideration...

00:20:42.635 --> 00:20:45.049
...I can continue
investigation without detention.

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:47.764
It's not a big deal.

00:20:49.712 --> 00:20:53.335
I got a recommendation from someone
a good lawyer who can help you.

00:20:53.472 --> 00:20:54.320
Wait a moment.

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:08.080
My daughter is coming?

00:22:12.342 --> 00:22:13.175
Mother?

00:22:15.651 --> 00:22:17.922
Why is it so hard for me to meet you?

00:22:19.894 --> 00:22:21.539
Are you busy?

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:26.390
Your face looks really bad.

00:22:27.858 --> 00:22:28.691
Why?

00:22:30.186 --> 00:22:31.659
Is something bothering you?

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:40.703
It doesn't matter.

00:22:42.578 --> 00:22:44.726
Everything will be fine.

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:47.675
My daughter...

00:22:49.778 --> 00:22:52.023
...a very good boy.

00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:22.926
Damn it!

00:23:22.951 --> 00:23:24.133
Damn it!

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:25.246
- Over there.
- Yes.

00:23:28.705 --> 00:23:29.538
Stop!

00:23:30.255 --> 00:23:31.088
Unlucky.

00:23:33.569 --> 00:23:34.993
Oh my gosh, that guy!

00:23:40.224 --> 00:23:41.057
Damn it.

00:23:45.159 --> 00:23:45.992
I give up.

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:46.953
Okay.

00:23:47.166 --> 00:23:47.885
Okay.

00:23:48.431 --> 00:23:49.264
Geez.

00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:58.650
Unlucky.

00:24:05.472 --> 00:24:06.837
Go ahead, you guys.

00:24:14.876 --> 00:24:15.709
Unlucky.

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:25.627
I told you I would catch you, didn't I?

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:31.816
I came to escort the thief.

00:24:31.841 --> 00:24:32.674
Jung Hyun!

00:24:33.434 --> 00:24:34.267
What's this?

00:24:36.678 --> 00:24:37.549
What's this?

00:24:39.191 --> 00:24:43.666
I caught him at the scene of the theft and
immediately get the stolen goods.

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:47.339
Additional checks
I leave it to the crime team.

00:24:47.365 --> 00:24:49.456
Kwon Hyung-jo, you came again?

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:50.568
You're such a jerk!

00:24:50.798 --> 00:24:52.203
This is the basis of human nature.

00:24:52.383 --> 00:24:54.307
Please be kind to me.

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:55.280
Why are you silent?

00:24:55.326 --> 00:24:57.154
- I...
- You move aside first.

00:24:57.426 --> 00:25:01.041
You look great in that uniform.

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:03.240
Are you comfortable at the police station?

00:25:03.319 --> 00:25:04.299
Jung Jung Hyun.

00:25:04.485 --> 00:25:08.584
If it's just theft, it should be
taken to the criminal investigation unit, not to the crime squad!

00:25:08.648 --> 00:25:09.481
Good grief.

00:25:09.745 --> 00:25:11.830
What is wrong with you?

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:14.616
In this way, I also
can see your face again.

00:25:14.664 --> 00:25:16.600
You are like a normal human being.

00:25:16.763 --> 00:25:20.049
What do you learn in
out there until it became like this?

00:25:20.074 --> 00:25:21.544
He learned good things.

00:25:21.614 --> 00:25:23.201
- You pushed me?
- Geez.

00:25:23.269 --> 00:25:25.604
Is there anything good happening?

00:25:25.641 --> 00:25:28.047
Yes, you look in a good mood.

00:25:28.407 --> 00:25:29.284
Good thing?

00:25:32.595 --> 00:25:33.428
Of course there is.

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:35.354
SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL

00:25:43.223 --> 00:25:44.245
The size is just right.

00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:46.057
The previous one was too big.

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:49.893
But next year,
I will also grow taller.

00:25:51.311 --> 00:25:53.235
Just use the right size.

00:25:53.284 --> 00:25:55.541
No way, I prefer the previous one.

00:25:59.101 --> 00:25:59.934
Se-eun.

00:26:01.043 --> 00:26:02.166
Uncle!

00:26:06.999 --> 00:26:08.049
What is it?

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:09.432
He looked annoyed.

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:14.478
I grew tall very fast. But Brother
told me to just buy the right size.

00:26:14.557 --> 00:26:16.582
You're only that tall.

00:26:16.614 --> 00:26:18.784
How did you know that?

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:22.603
Bet the names are really only three?

00:26:26.432 --> 00:26:28.526
You really only need three name bets?

00:26:28.551 --> 00:26:29.927
Yes, that's enough.

00:26:41.595 --> 00:26:43.199
SEO SE EUN

00:26:49.455 --> 00:26:51.236
Tada!

00:26:51.283 --> 00:26:52.166
How?

00:26:54.048 --> 00:26:54.995
It fits perfectly.

00:26:55.046 --> 00:26:55.879
Very beautiful.

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:59.600
Please also calculate the large size
that the child liked earlier.

00:26:59.625 --> 00:27:00.458
Yes.

00:27:01.693 --> 00:27:02.739
Let me see.

00:27:08.048 --> 00:27:09.049
You like?

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:10.353
Yes.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:12.833
Base.

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:15.299
Cool.

00:27:32.916 --> 00:27:34.541
Number 9108, there is a visit.

00:29:46.057 --> 00:29:49.093
I'm coming, Brother.

00:29:52.481 --> 00:29:56.468
I'm very late, aren't I?

00:29:58.894 --> 00:29:59.835
Excuse me.

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:09.781
Thank You.

00:30:23.761 --> 00:30:27.491
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING
HUNTER WITH A SCALPEL

00:30:27.789 --> 00:30:30.511
