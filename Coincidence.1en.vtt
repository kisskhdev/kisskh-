00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.040
(This drama is based on a true story.)

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:02.040
(The plot was adjusted for entertainment purposes only.)

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.040
(We have no intention to offend any careers, )

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.040
(encourage immoral sexual values, )

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.040
(or create a pessimistic disposition of a gender or a group of people.)

00:00:05.041 --> 00:00:07.840
(We would like to apologize in advance for any misunderstandings.)

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.440
(Presents)

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:25.000
(Theory of Love)

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.280
Hello, Aoy and Chod.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.320
I'm Uea.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.280
I'm 25 years old.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.920
I'm a librarian at a college library.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.600
I just got married.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.960
A time that should be the happiest in a woman's life.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.560
But for me,

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.480
that happiness didn’t last long.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.160
He left me too soon.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.720
"It was as if your time had stopped,"

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.800
"while mine..."

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.040
"kept moving..."

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.800
"and moving."

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.199
Why didn’t you turn on the AC when you arrived first?

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.200
How many times have I told you?

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.680
I’ll do it now.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.720
I remind you every day, and you still forget.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.280
Look at this. Nothing’s organized.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.040
What was the point of coming in early?

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.840
I can't breathe. It's boiling hot in here.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.920
He passed away doing something he loved.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.120
After his death,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.800
his parents cut me off.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.640
("What Do I Do With My Life?")

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.400
I don’t know if it’s because of my unstable career,

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.440
or because they were angry

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.800
they didn’t get millions from his life insurance

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.960
since my husband listed me as the sole beneficiary.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.920
"I will never find another you."

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.160
Uea, I want to return this book.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.560
Some people have tried to get close to me,

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.280
but it’s like my heart died with my husband.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.520
How many times do I have to tell you

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.879
to remove the sticky notes before returning a book

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:07.880
so that it doesn't waste my time?

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:08.960
Come on.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.720
Aren’t you even going to check what I bookmarked?

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.720
They’re sections I want you to read.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.280
Here.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.800
Return it to the box next time.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.200
Not here.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.480
(New Books)

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.240
I was consumed by sorrow for almost three months

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.560
until something unexpected happened.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.640
A guy added me on social media.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.400
(Tim Teeradol)

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.320
He said he was in my husband’s paramotor group.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.360
They used to hang out often.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.640
(Tim Teeradol: Hello. Are you Uea?)

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.840
We chatted for a while.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.680
Before I knew it, we were talking every day.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:07.760
(- Are you free this Saturday? - Why are you asking, Tim?)

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:08.840
(I know a nice cafe. I want to take you there.)

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.320
At first, we talked about my husband.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.800
But then we ended up talking for months.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.280
One day, he asked to meet up.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.360
(I want to return Jate's stuff to you.)

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.080
I worried if it was too soon

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.200
or if I was moving on too fast.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.520
I told myself it might mean nothing.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.080
He was just my husband’s friend.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.320
But when I met him,

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.520
my heart skipped a beat.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.040
He reminded me so much of my husband.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.080
His style, his walk,

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:11.800
even his smile.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.520
You must be Uea.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:20.440
Yes.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.680
- Are you Tim? - Yes.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.560
You’re exactly like what Jate told me.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.120
What did he say?

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.160
He said you’re pretty and smart.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.920
He also said he felt dumb around you.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.280
How do you know I’m smart?

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.280
We just met.

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.480
I can tell just by looking at your face.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.360
I want to return this to you.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.080
Jate’s harness.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:55.800
I borrowed it a long time ago.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.360
Thank you.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.440
I’ve never seen this before.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.480
He probably just bought it. It was new.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.160
But I borrowed it first.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.440
You and Jate were probably close.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.360
Have we met before?

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.160
Yes, Uea.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.320
I went to your wedding.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.440
At a hotel near Asok?

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:31.880
Yes.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.680
There were so many guests, I can’t even remember.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.720
- I'm sorry. - It's fine.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.760
I was working in the States for some time.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.600
That was probably when he started dating you,

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:47.520
so we never crossed paths.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.720
But now I’m back for good.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.320
What are you doing these days?

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.560
I’m a creative director for a few TV shows.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:58.960
Like Jate was.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.760
You’re right, but Jate worked on commercials.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.400
We actually crossed paths before.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.720
Jate and I were more like flying buddies.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.440
We went everywhere together.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.760
While I was listening to him,

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.320
I accidentally thought

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.840
that this was my husband.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.000
He was still alive.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.639
And he was gone for a few months.

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:25.919
He always called and asked me

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.360
- to come up with plans. - Now he’s back,

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.839
sitting right in front of me.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.600
- You know what I mean? - Yes.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:49.960
- Tim. - Yes?

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.320
Do you believe in true love?

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.960
Like soulmates?

00:07:58.840 --> 00:07:59.840
Yes.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.080
I do. What about you?

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.720
Science says

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.600
true love doesn’t exist.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:22.840
We’re only about 72 percent compatible with another person.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.120
And that’s hard to find.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.160
But...

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.120
Uea.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.440
What’s wrong? Why are you crying?

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:58.400
When Jate first died,

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:01.920
I thought

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:07.760
I would never find someone as compatible as him.

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:12.680
I thought

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.760
I could never love anyone else

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.480
until I met you.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:23.960
Uea.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.520
You scared me.

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.480
I’m also happy

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:33.520
that I met you.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.160
Everything was beautiful.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.760
He replaced my husband perfectly.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:46.360
Until some unexpected happened again.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.200
Chiang Mai, please.

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.400
You can go paramotoring in the mountains.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:54.960
I’ll visit an old bookstore in town.

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:56.640
It’s a win-win situation.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.240
Chiang Mai, please.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.160
But I’ve flown there so many times before.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.360
How about this? I’ll visit the bookstore with you.

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.280
I can help carry your stuff

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.600
and be your personal photographer. Sounds good?

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.080
- You said it yourself. - Of course.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.600
Anywhere else you want to go?

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:20.400
Well...

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.760
- A cafe? - Sure.

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:24.360
Just pick them.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.880
- Sure. - We could visit a hundred cafes.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.320
- Are you serious? - Yes.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:33.880
Do you want to go camping in the mountains?

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.360
Sounds good.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.999
- Camping then? - Sure.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.359
Maybe just for one night?

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:47.200
There’s a discount for two people.

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:54.640
You can take it.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:01.200
Sorry, I told them I’m off today, but they keep calling.

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:02.760
I’ll take the call.

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:25.160
Is everything okay? You look stressed.

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.600
It’s nothing.

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.600
Just the usual.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.680
This one’s cheaper than the other.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.080
A couple’s package. It's...

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.080
Hey, what did you just do?

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:48.920
I thought you said you were at the hospital.

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:50.800
Who's this?

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.320
A mental patient who steals people's boyfriends?

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.880
I’m begging you, please go home. I’ll tell you later.

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:02.400
No, let’s talk now.

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:04.680
What is all this about?

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:06.320
Why did you lie to me?

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:08.680
You should go now.

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:12.999
- I’ll explain everything. - No, let’s clear things up now.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Mom.

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.240
I want to talk to that wench too.

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:18.360
Why? Cat got your tongue?

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.520
Why weren’t you embarrassed when you did it?

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.720
- Why so quiet now? - Mom, let’s go home.

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.680
Preem, take your mother home.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:25.960
No.

00:12:25.961 --> 00:12:27.919
- I’m not leaving until I slap her. - Mom.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:29.679
Hey, don't.

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:30.879
That's enough. Let's go.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.640
- Preem, get the phone. - Hey.

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:33.960
I'll call you later, Uea.

00:12:33.961 --> 00:12:36.200
- Let go of me. - Come on.

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:37.560
- That's enough. - Why?

00:12:37.561 --> 00:12:39.760
Are you really that worried about your mistress?

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.680
How many times have you lied to me?

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:44.600
- Let go of me. - Stop, you're humiliating me.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:46.479
Let go of me.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.720
Stop it, that's enough.

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:53.800
Let's get you cleaned up.

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:04.760
I'll need to charge you for the strawberry drink.

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.999
I'm so sorry.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.999
- Like I said, - Please forgive me.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.080
this guy is so much like my husband,

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:19.920
even the way he tries to make it up to me.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:21.839
It’s like copy and paste.

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:23.640
Please forgive me.

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:24.960
Please.

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.240
I was called a mistress in public

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.720
and had to pay for the drink she poured on me.

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.400
How am I supposed to smile?

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.440
Phare is my ex-wife.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.480
The kid you saw

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:51.320
is my daughter.

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.240
We were in love,

00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.600
but that was a long time ago.

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.120
I asked for a divorce, but she wouldn’t agree.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.040
So I had to sue for divorce.

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:09.320
The case is still ongoing.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.520
Phare thinks that as long as it isn’t final,

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:15.960
she’s still my wife.

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.040
That’s why she acted out.

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.080
That's it, Uea.

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:26.560
Why didn’t you tell me you have a family?

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:31.400
I didn’t think it mattered for our love.

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.080
If you had known,

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:37.840
would you not love me?

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.400
But I had a right to know.

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:47.040
You’re right.

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:49.760
Fine.

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:53.440
It’s my fault. I didn’t think it through.

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:54.840
I’m sorry.

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:58.000
But I promise, from now on,

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.480
I won’t let Phare come near you again.

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.360
I’ll finalize everything as soon as I can.

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:06.360
So you can be at peace

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:08.200
and...

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:15.240
stop making that face at me.

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:18.800
Please forgive me.

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:24.800
My nose fell off.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.480
When you said you’d finalize the divorce as soon as you can,

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.160
how long will that take? When exactly?

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:44.640
Honestly,

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:46.600
I don’t know.

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:53.200
Phare holds grudges. You saw that yourself.

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:57.120
When I filed for divorce,

00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:00.040
she sued me back for money.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.520
She claimed I had to pay her this and that.

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.040
Plus legal fees.

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:09.640
It’s going to cost a lot.

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.080
I’m saving up.

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:15.560
How much are we talking about?

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:18.920
You don’t need to know.

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:23.600
I don’t want to worry you. Let me carry that burden.

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:26.320
Just tell me.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:28.320
I might be able to help you.

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:34.160
Just having you by my side makes me happy.

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:37.480
Tim.

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:41.440
If my money can help put an end to this,

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:43.080
I'm willing to help.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.640
Thank you so much

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:55.920
for helping me.

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:00.000
It’s for the sake of our relationship.

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:05.800
Come here.

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:07.400
- Thank you, Uea. - No problem.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:18.880
I’m really sorry for asking you to come again.

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:24.240
In an accident case, we must review everything multiple times.

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:27.800
It takes several months to process the documents.

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:30.720
It’s fine.

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:34.120
Should I sign here?

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:35.560
Yes.

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.200
(Claimant's Statement)

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:40.640
You’re the beneficiary of this money.

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:45.960
You’ll receive the insurance payout according to your husband’s policy.

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:49.400
As for the compensation insurance from the paramotor company,

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:52.080
we’re expediting the process.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:54.280
Thank you.

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:56.160
Is that all for today?

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:57.800
Yes.

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:01.600
If you need help with your financial planning,

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.680
feel free to contact me anytime.

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:06.280
We’d be more than happy to assist.

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.560
Thank you, but I’ve already done my financial planning.

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:13.360
All right.

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:15.880
Let me take care of these documents.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.440
Life insurance money from a husband

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.080
can help a woman start fresh,

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:33.640
so she doesn’t have to hold on to the past.

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:37.199
I’m sure my husband’d agree with me

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.280
giving my new man this money to fight his case,

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:44.240
so he can cut ties with his painful past as well.

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:52.080
But our future wasn’t as smooth as I had hoped.

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:03.560
Hello?

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.440
- Did you transfer the money to me? - Yes.

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:10.760
For you to fight your case,

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:13.160
so that hag will leave you alone.

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:15.600
But it’s too much.

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:17.480
I can't accept it.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.440
Let’s just call it even.

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:23.519
You’ve always paid for our meals

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:24.840
and dates.

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:27.480
Now it’s my turn to pay you back.

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.680
Okay, bye.

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:38.920
You'd never acted this cheerful since your husband passed away.

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:42.400
I got a new boyfriend.

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:44.760
Don’t you have one?

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:46.720
So you can be as cheerful as I am.

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:51.440
That brat.

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:15.480
Excuse me.

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:19.880
Do you have any books on how to deal with shameless people?

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:31.360
Where are you going?

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.280
They say

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:37.600
librarians are not service-minded.

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:42.080
How-to books are for self-improvement.

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:45.240
But what you really need

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:47.960
is probably...

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:57.200
"Toxic People".

00:20:58.680 --> 00:20:59.680
Are you interested?

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:02.920
So you can stop being toxic to people.

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:05.960
You're really shameless.

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:08.400
You’re living off my husband.

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:12.560
You see other people happy and get desperate to have him too.

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:13.800
Who’s living off whom?

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:16.120
Shut up if you don’t know anything.

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:17.680
You’re annoying me.

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:22.520
I wasn’t done talking.

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:25.480
Walking away is rude.

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:28.120
Aren’t there books on how to be a lady here?

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:32.080
(Keep Silence)

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:36.200
You're rude.

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:40.520
Let's go talk outside.

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:41.960
Why should I?

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:43.480
You should leave.

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:46.480
You got in with the 20-baht daily ticket?

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:53.720
Here’s your fee.

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:55.720
This wench!

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:01.040
Excuse me, this is a college.

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:06.200
You’re an outsider harassing a faculty member, and that’s wrong.

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:14.400
If you don’t leave my husband alone,

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.520
I won’t stop bothering you.

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:24.720
Are you all right?

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:26.160
I’m fine.

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:28.640
She’s crazy. Just ignore her.

(Sluttiest Librarian of the Year)

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:27.480
The dean asked me to handle this.

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:30.200
Is it really that serious?

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:33.480
How did he find out?

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:37.280
His computer and the college management’s computers were hacked.

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:41.240
Everyone’s screens showed your picture.

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:45.920
I don’t care about your personal life,

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:49.480
but you can’t let it affect your work.

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:55.120
I'm sorry.

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:57.560
I promise

00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:59.840
this will never happen again.

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:18.360
I found her.

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:21.720
Her profile states that she graduated in computer science

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:23.760
and worked as a programmer.

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:27.040
No wonder she’s so good with computers.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.800
But I could only see her few posts.

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:32.720
She probably sets her posts to be visible only to friends.

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:35.000
Except for one thing

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:36.840
she’s public about.

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:40.839
Like all moms, she loves sharing photos of her child.

Wait.

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:40.880

What's wrong, Mom? Why are you crying?

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:36.760
I'm sorry, dear.

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:39.280
I'm sorry.

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:43.080
I'm sorry.

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:58.440
It's okay. You'll be fine.

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:02.520
Preem, I'm so sorry.

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:07.680
At first, I thought I’d be mean because she was mean to me.

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.160
But seeing that

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:13.080
made me feel horrible.

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:16.360
- They say - I'm sorry.

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:18.920
if a woman finds out her man is cheating,

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:21.600
she hurts the other woman first.

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:26.280
I guess it’s true.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000
I admit I didn’t think this through.

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:41.880
Are you home?

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:43.320
Why are you home late today?

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:46.840
Uea, what have you done?

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:48.879
I've been cooking.

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:50.040
Does it smell good?

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:54.360
This isn't funny.

00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:56.880
What did you do this afternoon?

00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:58.640
Oh.

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.080
Were you with that old hag?

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:04.720
Was she still pretending to cry?

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.640
This isn't a joke. What did you do to her?

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:14.600
What did she tell you?

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:18.560
Phare said you humiliated her and Preem at school.

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:20.320
How could you?

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.480
Preem is only in second grade.

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:24.840
Is that all she told you?

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:26.440
So tell me.

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:31.480
She stormed into my workplace, screaming.

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:36.640
Everyone, from the cleaners to the dean,

00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:39.840
was gossiping that I’m a mistress, even though my husband just died.

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:46.440
She didn't tell you that, did she?

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:48.560
Here.

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:50.160
Look at this.

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:53.760
She didn't tell you she started it, did she?

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:00.080
You know what?

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:03.880
Since Jate died,

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:09.600
this is the worst day ever.

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:16.120
Instead of consoling me,

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:18.960
you scolded me

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:23.160
because that old hag played the victim and you listened to her.

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:43.360
Uea.

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:46.400
I'm sorry.

00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:49.360
I didn't know.

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:56.120
I'll talk to Phare and tell her to leave you alone.

00:29:58.120 --> 00:29:59.680
But you must promise me

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:02.480
that you'll leave her alone too.

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:06.440
If this happens again,

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:08.280
she'll tell the judge

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:09.880
that we're a danger to my child.

00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:13.520
Phare won't let me see her.

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:18.720
Please stay away from each other.

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:20.920
Please, promise me.

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:46.080
Besides you and Preem,

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:50.360
I have no one left, Uea.

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:55.640
If we let this continue,

00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:06.640
I'll lose you both. Please understand me.

00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:22.760
Tim.

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:30.040
I promise

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:32.520
I'll leave her alone.

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:39.160
I'm sorry for putting you through this.

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:51.480
I'm sorry about the food. I was too angry.

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:54.280
Let's go grab some food.

00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:00.799
I'm sorry. I'll clean it up.

00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:02.880
- It's okay. I'll do it. - I'll help you.

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:14.440
Tim.

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:16.440
It's dirty.

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:19.600
That’s one sweet thing about him, just like my husband.

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:22.600
No matter how big the fight

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:24.680
or how mad I got,

00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:26.520
he could always

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:29.520
make me smile in the end.

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:37.720
(Mrs. Ueaari Jitcharoensuk Librarian)

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:40.680
Tell me. How are you going to take responsibility?

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:42.680
What?

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:45.640
I don’t want to cause trouble, but you keep showing up.

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:49.160
My kid’s not going to school. How are you going to fix that?

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:50.440
Huh?

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:53.079
Your kid’s acting out, and you’re blaming me?

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:54.120
What kind of mother are you?

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.520
There are books on how to raise a child.

00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:00.040
Section SQ769. Go find it.

00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:02.480
The kids are bullying my child

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:05.560
saying her dad left and her mom’s jealous.

00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:07.480
She has been crying every day.

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:11.720
Do you realize this will traumatize her for life?

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:15.040
This is all your fault.

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:20.640
Wait.

00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:23.000
So change schools.

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:26.520
Leave me alone.

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:29.080
So I don't have to follow you to her next school.

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:31.760
(Lunch Break)

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.240
Hey.

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:41.680
Stop walking. Where are you going?

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:44.079
Hey, you wench. Stop.

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:45.160
Let go of me.

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:47.520
Hey, stop!

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:51.080
You think you can just walk away after dropping a bomb like that?

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:54.200
I was about to have a good life, and you ruined it.

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:57.520
I'm telling you I won’t lose him to you.

00:33:58.200 --> 00:33:59.440
You’re stupid.

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:01.880
He doesn’t even want you, but you keep clinging on.

00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:05.640
Go study feminism. Maybe then you’ll learn about self-respect.

00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:07.399
Hey, stop.

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:08.440
Listen to me, you crazy.

00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:11.560
He didn't leave me. We're still in love.

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:13.160
You’re the real scammer.

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:15.600
You scam people out of money better than the professionals.

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:19.000
Being a librarian doesn’t pay enough?

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:22.120
Try being a prostitute, maybe you’ll get 500 baht.

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:24.280
What are you talking about? Who is a scammer?

00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:25.880
I have money.

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:28.760
Just admit he's no longer your husband.

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:30.600
He's my boyfriend.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.439
You're making things up. You're crazy.

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:34.960
Are you insane?

00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:37.640
Huh? I'll slap some sense into you.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.840
Listen! I’ll protect my family with everything I have.

00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:46.520
If you try to destroy it, I won’t hold back.

00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:50.200
Hey.

00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:56.920
I’ll protect my relationship too.

00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:58.760
You're a crazy mother.

00:34:58.880 --> 00:34:59.880
Take that.

00:34:59.881 --> 00:35:02.599
- Oh dear. - Let go.

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:07.400
- I said stop it. - Let go of me.

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:09.519
Let go of me!

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:12.960
Go sleep with someone who isn't my husband.

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:14.680
Stop.

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:16.920
- Get her out of here. - Let go.

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:18.520
Stop them.

00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:20.040
That's enough.

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:22.079
- Come here. - Let go.

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:23.400
I said stop it!

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:31.520
How could you do this in a college?

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:37.760
I'm sorry, Ueaari.

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:40.880
We can’t keep you on.

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:43.920
You’re firing me?

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:47.000
But I love this college.

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:48.800
I studied here for four years.

00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:51.840
This was the only place I applied to after graduating.

00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:56.080
I’ve never taken leave or been late.

00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:58.640
Can’t you do anything?

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:00.840
This is serious.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.480
I’m sorry, but I can’t help you.

00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:10.280
But I live alone in Bangkok and have lots of expenses.

00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:13.640
If you’re going to fire me,

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:17.600
please give me a letter of recommendation.

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:21.440
Try being in my shoes.

00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:24.079
Would you recommend someone who got into

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:26.680
an adultery catfight at work?

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:36.960
How much compensation will I get?

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:41.560
We’ll ask you to resign,

00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:44.560
so it doesn’t damage your record.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.000
What?

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:52.360
So there’s no compensation?

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:54.800
You’re not exactly struggling.

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:58.400
Your late husband left you his life insurance policy.

00:36:58.600 --> 00:36:59.760
That has nothing to do with this.

00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:04.160
Are you going to hand in your resignation,

00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:06.440
or do you want us to press charges

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.760
for causing a disturbance on campus and assaulting staff members?

00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:13.000
It's your decision.

00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:29.320
(Mrs. Ueaari Jitcharoensuk)

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:33.840
Didn’t her husband just die?

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:37.160
She’s fabulous. Her husband just died,

00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:40.160
and now she’s sleeping with someone else’s husband.

00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:42.160
Maybe it’s because he died.

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:45.720
Some people just can’t handle being alone.

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:48.600
She can't handle it.

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:51.280
- Right? - Yes.

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:52.520
Don’t you think so?

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:54.160
Stop talking.

00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:57.280
Oh no.

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:17.240
Uea!

00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:20.560
Wait for me.

00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:22.960
Uea.

00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:25.280
Wait for me.

00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:27.800
Have you resigned? Where are you going now?

00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:31.240
I don't know. Maybe back home to Nakhon Sawan.

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:33.800
You're really going to let her win?

00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:35.360
This isn’t right.

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:38.120
It has nothing to do with you, James. Stay out of it.

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:40.200
Wait.

00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:41.720
Can I have your phone?

00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:44.079
- What for? - Just give it to me.

00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:45.920
- James... - Hold on.

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:47.560
We probably won’t see each other again.

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:56.520
This is my number, just in case.

00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:58.040
Okay.

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:12.760
(Tim)

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:18.600
Uea, open the door. It's me.

00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:22.240
Uea.

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:31.640
Don't ignore me.

00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:34.120
I know you're behind the door.

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:37.360
Uea.

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:44.200
I'm sorry. Come out and talk to me.

00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:48.720
If you don't come out,

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:50.720
I'll keep calling you.

00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:52.320
Uea.

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:54.440
- Uea. - Stop it.

00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:58.200
Stay with your ex-wife if she's that possessive of you.

00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:00.160
You can’t do anything.

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:02.880
I'm sorry, Uea.

00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:05.680
I'm sorry on behalf of Phare.

00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:10.440
This will never happen again.

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:18.880
I've asked the lawyer to file

00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:21.120
for a restraining order against her.

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:39.440
See? I'm not just sitting idly by.

00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:41.920
I'm here for you.

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:46.560
I'm doing everything I can to make things right

00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:50.000
for our future.

00:41:58.600 --> 00:41:59.600
Uea.

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:02.640
I'm sorry.

00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:07.080
Tim.

00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:09.880
Do you know that I got fired?

00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:13.200
Because your ex-wife showed up at my workplace and slapped me.

00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:18.400
Uea.

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:20.560
Are you free today?

00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:22.800
Of course I am.

00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:25.520
I just said I'm unemployed. Why do you ask?

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:29.480
I want to take you somewhere.

00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:31.400
Where?

00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:38.760
Wait.

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:41.840
We drove four hours to Ratchaburi

00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:45.240
just to see a field.

00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:50.760
Do you like it? It’s my land.

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:54.520
But from now on,

00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:56.680
it’ll be yours too.

00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:00.360
My dad left it to me,

00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:03.720
saying I should use it to build a life with my wife.

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:12.960
Right now, it’s just an empty field.

00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:15.480
But it won’t stay that way.

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:18.600
What business should we do?

00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:20.640
I’ll leave that to you.

00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:23.120
We could open a cafe.

00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:26.680
Tim.

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:29.480
You read my mind.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.360
I’ve always dreamed

00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:36.320
of opening a cafe

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:40.280
with books for customers to read,

00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:43.760
like a library concept.

00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:47.680
That’s a great idea. It really suits you.

00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:49.400
Sounds perfect.

00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:54.920
But you probably need to look for inspiration first.

00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:56.840
Let me save up a bit more.

00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:59.840
I'll build a cafe just the way you want.

00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:02.480
Just give me a few years.

00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:07.680
But I don't want to wait.

00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:10.120
Let’s just do it.

00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:12.880
I have some money saved up.

00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:18.160
What money?

00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:23.400
This is the last of it. Please check.

00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:34.760
Everything looks good. Thank you.

00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:36.240
Okay.

00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:38.520
Like I mentioned earlier,

00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:43.120
you can use our financial advisor service free of charge.

00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:47.080
Even if you have money, life can still be unpredictable.

00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:50.840
I have plans to start a business.

00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:54.280
This money can really help it grow.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.280
Every investment comes with risk.

00:44:57.760 --> 00:44:59.840
We also offer investment consulting.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.600
It’s just a small cafe.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.560
I’m opening it with my boyfriend, nothing to worry about.

00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:09.800
If there’s nothing else, please excuse me.

00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:12.560
Okay, I’ll see you out.

00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:26.400
I’ll get going then. Good luck.

00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:27.880
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:31.120
Hello, Pornapha.

00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:32.800
Please follow me.

00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:40.880
Do you know each other?

00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:44.480
I don’t really want to.

00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:46.960
But karma keeps making us run into each other.

00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:49.520
You even followed me here.

00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:52.040
There’s a restraining order from the court.

00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:54.560
You're not allowed to harass me.

00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:56.200
What are you talking about?

00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:58.040
I’m here on my own business.

00:45:58.280 --> 00:45:59.280
What business?

00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:03.160
Don't be nosy.

00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:06.160
- You hag! - Don't.

00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:09.080
Pornapha is here to claim the insurance money

00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:12.080
her late husband left her before he passed, just like you.

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:14.680
- Late husband’s insurance money? - Late husband’s insurance money?

00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:16.640
Yes.

00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:20.720
Wait, is your husband really dead?

00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:23.880
Or are you making this up to scam the company?

00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:26.600
You need to investigate further, Wisit.

00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:29.080
Don’t let her take any money. Do a thorough check.

00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:31.920
Wisit, her husband’s not dead.

00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:33.640
They’re still in court.

00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:36.920
She’s a scammer trying to get insurance money.

00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:40.319
You’re the scammer. I have all the documents.

00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:42.200
- Look at mine. - Have a look at mine.

00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:45.160
Don’t accuse me. I’m not a scammer. Look at this.

00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:47.880
Look at mine. Mine’s real. Yours is fake.

00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:06.040
You’re not a scammer.

00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:07.920
I’m not either.

00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:11.400
Then who is?

00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:36.960
Trying to win doesn’t help anyone.

00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:40.200
The more you want to win, the more you lose control.

00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:42.520
I’m Ake.

00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:44.360
I’m a surgeon here.

00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:46.880
Do you have to dress so young around that girl?

00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:50.320
Where are your glasses? Where did you get the clothes from?

00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:52.160
She asked me to wear them.

00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:53.760
What?

00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:55.720
Are you sure this land belongs to you?

00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:56.920
I am.

00:47:57.240 --> 00:47:58.520
I remember this tree.

00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:00.959
Ake, I’m not dumb.

00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:03.679
How dare you try to scam me? You’ll definitely pay for this.

00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:06.880
Calm down. Let’s plan carefully.

00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:09.280
We’ll outsmart him when he least expects it.

00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:10.960
He scammed us, so we scam him back.

00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:18.600
A new, fabulous kind of treatment.

00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:20.920
I want everyone to smell this.

00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:22.480
- All right. - Billiant.

00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:25.159
If someone says your mother is dangerous, what do you say?

00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:26.760
That's my mother, not me.

00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:29.720
- She's not defending her. - Not going to protect your mother?

00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:34.120
- Tim. - Cut.

00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:35.399
Why were you smiling?

00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:36.400
Cut.

00:48:36.401 --> 00:48:37.560
Smile and eat.

00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:39.760
The cauliflower tastes good, even after it fell on the floor.
