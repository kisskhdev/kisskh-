00:21:35.128 --> 00:21:36.129
Shit.

00:21:53.271 --> 00:21:54.647
- [Han-na groans]
- [Dong-ju grunts]

00:21:56.774 --> 00:21:57.942
[groans] Shit.

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:02.321
[Dong-ju] Han-na.

00:22:02.905 --> 00:22:04.115
Everything okay?

00:22:04.198 --> 00:22:05.450
Han-na.

00:22:05.533 --> 00:22:06.909
Han-na!

00:22:06.993 --> 00:22:09.037
Han-na, can you hear me? Ji Han-na!

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:10.121
Han-na!

00:22:11.497 --> 00:22:14.417
You don't need to shout.
You're hurting my ears.

00:22:18.671 --> 00:22:19.751
You sure everything's okay?

00:22:24.385 --> 00:22:27.221
You shouldn't have come here
all by yourself, it's dangerous.

00:22:30.975 --> 00:22:32.060
Seriously.

00:22:41.944 --> 00:22:43.029
[door opens]

00:22:44.822 --> 00:22:45.823
[Han-na grunts]

00:22:55.458 --> 00:22:56.709
Yoon Dong-ju.

00:22:56.793 --> 00:22:57.919
You all right?

00:23:02.757 --> 00:23:04.717
[Jae-Hong] Are you all right?
You're bleeding.

00:23:08.137 --> 00:23:10.431
Min Ju-yeong?
Where'd that piece of shit go?

00:23:27.031 --> 00:23:28.282
Look like she's still alive.

00:23:28.366 --> 00:23:30.326
Do we need an ambulance? I can call them.

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:02.859
[pensive music playing]

00:24:07.238 --> 00:24:08.656
Nothing's broken, I think.

00:24:10.158 --> 00:24:12.243
- [medic] Hold still.
- [thug groans]

00:24:15.163 --> 00:24:16.581
- Reporting for duty.
- Oh, hey.

00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:39.687
[Man-sik sighs] National team or police,
it's the same story.

00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:42.356
You're always getting banged up. [Sighs]

00:24:44.317 --> 00:24:47.320
Looks like riot police and the fire crew
swept the whole building.

00:24:48.321 --> 00:24:50.031
Min's nowhere to be found.

00:24:50.114 --> 00:24:52.867
Same with the transport vehicles,
no trace of him at all.

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:54.110
I bet he slipped out already.

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:57.872
I think he's got more than just one or two
moles in the force, don't you think?

00:24:57.955 --> 00:24:59.624
I bet they're all busy hiding him.

00:24:59.707 --> 00:25:01.267
That's why we need to get that asshole.

00:25:02.793 --> 00:25:03.794
"We"?

00:25:04.921 --> 00:25:08.549
You're a wanted man, you understand that?
Stay out of it for Christ's sake!

00:25:08.633 --> 00:25:09.717
Hang on.

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:12.720
How are we gonna get this little punk
outta here, any ideas?

00:25:13.387 --> 00:25:14.555
Moles?

00:25:16.015 --> 00:25:17.266
What?

00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:22.897
I think someone talked to Min Ju-yeong
and told him that I was here.

00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:25.524
His phone.

00:25:27.443 --> 00:25:31.280
We can find out about the mole
by checking who he talked to last.

00:25:33.574 --> 00:25:37.912
SAFETY IS OUR TOP PRIORITY
ON THIS CONSTRUCTION SITE

00:25:40.248 --> 00:25:43.000
Man, there's so much trash in there.
What a mess.

00:25:48.381 --> 00:25:49.507
Yeah, I heard you.

00:25:55.846 --> 00:25:57.348
Oh, the nausea!

00:25:57.431 --> 00:25:59.871
- It's my anemia. Oh, God!
- Captain! Captain! What's happening?

00:26:04.814 --> 00:26:06.023
You got it, sir?

00:26:08.484 --> 00:26:10.486
You got the phone,
so why don't you get up?

00:26:12.405 --> 00:26:14.031
- [grunts] Come on, sir.
- Yeah?

00:26:14.657 --> 00:26:16.325
God, that was nasty!

00:26:18.369 --> 00:26:20.579
You think they can recover the data?

00:26:20.663 --> 00:26:22.263
As long as the SIM card is still intact.

00:26:22.331 --> 00:26:24.250
I'll have the forensics chief
give it a shot.

00:26:24.333 --> 00:26:26.585
- What are they saying?
- [car horn honks]

00:26:26.669 --> 00:26:28.379
- [gates opening]
- [clamoring]

00:26:28.462 --> 00:26:29.463
[Jae-Hong] Captain.

00:26:30.006 --> 00:26:32.174
- [reporters clamoring]
- [dramatic music playing]

00:26:45.021 --> 00:26:46.105
What?

00:26:48.107 --> 00:26:49.400
[Pan-yeol clears throat]

00:26:49.942 --> 00:26:52.695
Oh! Good to see you, Sir! Sir.

00:26:52.778 --> 00:26:54.363
Listen, sir.

00:26:55.072 --> 00:26:56.073
Oh?

00:26:56.157 --> 00:26:58.909
- What, uh… happened to your jaw, sir?
- Now listen!

00:27:02.496 --> 00:27:04.290
[stutters] Where's Yoon Dong-ju?

00:27:04.874 --> 00:27:06.042
Tell me right now.

00:27:06.667 --> 00:27:07.960
- Oh, shit.
- [Man-sik] I'm sorry?

00:27:08.044 --> 00:27:10.171
Yoon Dong-ju, you dumb-ass.

00:27:10.254 --> 00:27:12.423
Oh. Yoon Dong-ju, sir?

00:27:13.174 --> 00:27:16.093
- I-I don't know, sir.
- [Pan-yeol] You don't know?

00:27:16.177 --> 00:27:17.178
God, this sucks.

00:27:17.261 --> 00:27:18.763
[Pan-yeol] Of course you'd say that!

00:27:21.932 --> 00:27:25.102
[scoffs] All of you little shits!

00:27:25.186 --> 00:27:26.812
I should've just broken his jaw.

00:27:26.896 --> 00:27:29.690
[Pan-yeol] You all can kiss
your damn jobs goodbye, you got that?

00:27:29.774 --> 00:27:33.194
And you're the first to go, you idiot!
Oh, I could just…

00:27:33.861 --> 00:27:36.447
Don't you move, you ungrateful worm you!

00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:37.948
Now stand at attention!

00:27:39.075 --> 00:27:40.076
Yes, sir.

00:27:46.582 --> 00:27:47.583
Shit, shit, shit.

00:27:50.294 --> 00:27:52.064
<i>There's no more doubt that
a new type of narcotic…</i>

00:27:52.088 --> 00:27:54.465
[sighs] It's a total bust, isn't it?

00:27:55.257 --> 00:27:57.444
- What the hell is happening here?
- <i>The operation was carried out</i>

00:27:57.468 --> 00:27:59.188
- <i>under Insung Police Commissioner…</i>
- Goddamn.

00:27:59.261 --> 00:28:01.865
<i>Who launched a large-scale crackdown
with support from the riot police.</i>

00:28:01.889 --> 00:28:02.890
[vehicle approaching]

00:28:03.641 --> 00:28:04.642
Hey, hey, hey.

00:28:13.317 --> 00:28:14.777
- What the hell happened?
- Goddamn it.

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:16.153
You saw the news?

00:28:17.405 --> 00:28:18.965
This is out of control, what's going on?

00:28:18.989 --> 00:28:21.826
It's all blowing up on the news,
and Min's MIA.

00:28:21.909 --> 00:28:24.495
You look like you got your ass beat again.
What happened to you?

00:28:24.578 --> 00:28:26.455
Shut up, you idiot!

00:28:26.539 --> 00:28:28.433
The thing is we couldn't get
half of our product out

00:28:28.457 --> 00:28:30.918
because you dragged your fucking ass
sending the trucks!

00:28:35.881 --> 00:28:37.007
[sighs] Shit!

00:28:38.092 --> 00:28:39.635
[car engine revving]

[tires screech]

00:28:45.349 --> 00:28:46.600
[subordinate] Hey, boss.

00:28:46.684 --> 00:28:48.727
What's the deal? Did you find out?

00:28:48.811 --> 00:28:50.396
I couldn't get a hold of anyone.

00:28:50.479 --> 00:28:52.148
And Min Ju-Yeong has fucking disappeared

00:28:52.231 --> 00:28:53.566
[sighs]

00:28:55.109 --> 00:28:57.445
And now
we look like a bunch of clowns, huh?

00:28:59.905 --> 00:29:01.740
So what do we do about the product, boss?

00:29:06.537 --> 00:29:08.622
It's worth hundreds of billions of won…

00:29:11.584 --> 00:29:13.294
If we off-load it at a cheap price.

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:17.965
Min's gone dark as far as we know.

00:29:19.758 --> 00:29:21.760
And now the cook's dead and gone,

00:29:21.844 --> 00:29:24.180
as well as that rat
who was gonna take it all.

00:29:24.263 --> 00:29:26.390
Which means the only guy
who knows that we have it…

00:29:28.476 --> 00:29:29.894
Is here with you and me.

00:29:35.691 --> 00:29:37.318
Hey, where are the goods?

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:40.070
Okay, understood.

00:29:40.154 --> 00:29:42.907
Oh, and how many guys can you round up
right now?

00:29:44.283 --> 00:29:47.036
Yeah, it's urgent.
Just get everyone you can, all right?

00:29:48.078 --> 00:29:49.413
Okay, I'll call you later.

00:29:49.997 --> 00:29:50.998
[door opens]

00:29:51.999 --> 00:29:53.417
Oh, shit.

00:30:06.305 --> 00:30:07.681
You going somewhere?

00:30:14.021 --> 00:30:15.147
Is this a prank?

00:30:17.024 --> 00:30:18.692
For God's sake.

00:30:24.156 --> 00:30:25.824
You should be careful, kid.

00:30:25.908 --> 00:30:27.952
You know I'm a heavyweight champion.

00:30:28.661 --> 00:30:29.745
Don't mess with me.

00:30:29.828 --> 00:30:30.829
[scoffs]

- It's your fingerprint that unlocks it.
- [automated voice] <i>The door is open.</i>

00:30:53.102 --> 00:30:55.145
- [Man-sik] Hey.
- Oh. Hey, Dad!

00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:58.732
Aw, sweet Jeong-a, watching the news,
worrying about her dad.

00:30:58.816 --> 00:30:59.817
What are you saying?

00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:01.777
Some braised chicken for you!

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:03.654
- [chuckles]
- Oh. It's braised chicken?

00:31:04.154 --> 00:31:06.240
Oh, sweet. I could eat all of it.

00:31:06.323 --> 00:31:08.033
Yeah, you'd like that. Wouldn't you?

00:31:08.117 --> 00:31:10.869
You lie around the house,
doing absolutely nothing worth mentioning.

00:31:10.953 --> 00:31:13.139
Hey, guys. What are you waiting for?
Get in. We've been through hell.

00:31:13.163 --> 00:31:14.748
We deserve some food, at least.

00:31:15.249 --> 00:31:17.126
- Hi, Jeong-a.
- [Jeong-a] Oh.

00:31:17.209 --> 00:31:19.646
[Man-sik] You remember them, right?
Say hi. These are my colleagues.

00:31:19.670 --> 00:31:21.672
And this is my daughter, Go Jeong-a.

00:31:23.424 --> 00:31:24.800
[Jong-hyeon] I'm sorry to intrude.

00:31:25.801 --> 00:31:28.012
[romantic music playing]

00:31:28.804 --> 00:31:30.139
Hello.

00:31:32.641 --> 00:31:33.961
[Man-sik] Hey, take some chicken!

00:31:34.018 --> 00:31:35.102
- Cheers.
- [Jong-hyeon sighs]

00:31:35.185 --> 00:31:37.313
- Good work today.
- [Jae-Hong] Good work today, guys.

00:31:43.319 --> 00:31:44.320
[Dong-ju] Whoa.

00:31:44.903 --> 00:31:47.573
Wrap it in aged kimchi first.
It's insanely good.

00:31:47.656 --> 00:31:50.534
I had it with Jeong-a pretty recently
and I still think about it.

00:31:51.619 --> 00:31:53.621
You just wrap it like this and…

00:31:57.041 --> 00:31:58.542
It's so good, right?

00:31:59.126 --> 00:32:01.128
- This is pretty good.
- It's really that good?

00:32:02.004 --> 00:32:04.006
I like this one better, it's more tender.

00:32:07.468 --> 00:32:08.469
Mmm…

00:32:08.552 --> 00:32:10.012
You say it's very tender?

00:32:12.097 --> 00:32:14.516
[Man-sik] Ji, I've gotta say
I'm a little hurt, you know.

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:17.895
I just mean, regarding your dad.
I was totally unaware.

00:32:17.978 --> 00:32:20.373
You should've given us a heads-up
at some point, don't you think?

00:32:20.397 --> 00:32:22.941
Why'd you keep that bottled up
for so long?

00:32:23.025 --> 00:32:25.611
I'm just…
I'm just a little bit hurt, okay?

00:32:25.694 --> 00:32:26.945
I'm sorry about that.

00:32:27.029 --> 00:32:29.657
Han-na had to suffer through this,
why are you going after her?

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:31.325
Let's try and get that bastard instead.

00:32:31.408 --> 00:32:33.261
Will you stop talking
about "getting that bastard"?

00:32:33.285 --> 00:32:35.037
- Try some.
- You're still on the wanted list.

00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:37.599
And you're staying home until we've dealt
with the matter, you understand?

00:32:37.623 --> 00:32:39.333
- Stay out of it, punk.
- [smacks lips]

00:32:39.917 --> 00:32:41.502
So what's the plan now, sir?

00:32:42.086 --> 00:32:43.671
We catch him, of course.

00:32:43.754 --> 00:32:44.838
Yeah, we do.

00:32:44.922 --> 00:32:47.150
Thing is, the prosecution has
joined forces with the police.

00:32:47.174 --> 00:32:49.343
So it's gonna be hard for us to step in.

00:32:49.426 --> 00:32:53.639
- We're not gonna get any backup either.
- So then it's just us, the RIU,

00:32:53.722 --> 00:32:56.558
and if we're lucky,
Senior Inspector Kang from Seobu Station?

00:32:57.810 --> 00:33:00.104
Kang won't be able to help us, I think.

00:33:00.813 --> 00:33:03.649
I'm sure their hands are tied,
and they've been disciplined already.

00:33:06.026 --> 00:33:09.571
So it's just gonna be us
with the RIU, hopefully.

00:33:10.072 --> 00:33:11.073
But, still…

00:33:11.699 --> 00:33:14.743
Stop it, will you? Stop eating,
I'm talking about something important!

00:33:14.827 --> 00:33:15.911
[groans]

00:33:17.538 --> 00:33:18.539
[Man-sik] Huh?

00:33:18.622 --> 00:33:19.998
You being weird again?

00:33:20.082 --> 00:33:23.669
Didn't I tell you to quit doing that?
Where'd you even pick up this nonsense?

00:33:23.752 --> 00:33:26.046
- It's Lamaze breathing.
- "Lama"?

00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:28.048
[Jae-Hong] No, Lamaze breathing.

00:33:28.132 --> 00:33:30.551
You calm down your nerves
by breathing that way.

00:33:30.634 --> 00:33:33.387
I know because my wife used to do it
when she was pregnant.

00:33:34.346 --> 00:33:35.806
[quirky music playing]

00:33:48.777 --> 00:33:51.613

[both hiccup]

00:33:58.036 --> 00:33:59.121
Wait, Jeong-a!

00:34:00.122 --> 00:34:01.582
Jeong-a, open the door!

00:34:01.665 --> 00:34:04.001
Just talk to me, okay? Hey, open up.

00:34:04.084 --> 00:34:06.712
Is that the reason you fought
with your mother and came back here?

00:34:07.296 --> 00:34:08.422
Come on, Jeong-A. Open up!

00:34:09.298 --> 00:34:11.300
The Captain's gonna be okay, right?

00:34:11.383 --> 00:34:13.552
I shouldn't have said anything
about the breathing.

00:34:13.635 --> 00:34:15.179
- It's okay.
- [Jong-hyeon sighs]

00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:17.639
Is your hand okay?

00:34:17.723 --> 00:34:20.350
Oh, also, you sure
none of you need to go to the hospital?

00:34:21.101 --> 00:34:22.728
Oh, I'm okay.

00:34:25.481 --> 00:34:26.857
We're all right, yeah.

00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:28.400
Okay, then, why don't we head out?

00:34:28.984 --> 00:34:30.944
I've never wanted to go home
more than I do now.

00:34:31.028 --> 00:34:32.279
Sounds good.

00:34:32.362 --> 00:34:34.215
I can give you a ride,
we're heading the same way.

00:34:34.239 --> 00:34:35.282
Oh, that'd be great.

00:34:35.783 --> 00:34:36.825
And you two?

00:34:38.368 --> 00:34:40.208
All right, good night then.
See you both later.

[Jae-Hong grunts]

00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:45.501
- Let's do a group hug.
- Let's just go.

00:34:45.584 --> 00:34:46.877
- Oh, okay.
- [Han-na chuckles]

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:47.961
Later.

Hey, sweetie, I'm back now.

00:35:18.909 --> 00:35:21.203
I'm sorry.
You must've been really worried.

00:35:21.286 --> 00:35:22.472
[newscaster] <i>There are still reports</i>

Hey, you know what?

00:35:38.011 --> 00:35:40.639
That bronze medal has always
made me feel ashamed.

00:35:41.723 --> 00:35:43.600
Felt like I didn't give it my all.

00:35:44.226 --> 00:35:46.103
Like I didn't try hard enough
my whole life.

00:35:46.687 --> 00:35:49.439
That's why I could never show it
to our kids with pride.

Hmm?

Listen, not once have our kids ever been
ashamed of their father, you hear me?

00:35:59.157 --> 00:36:02.327
You should've seen how happy they were
to get to watch you on the news.

Okay, wait.

Here.

- Dong-ju.
- Hmm?

00:36:26.059 --> 00:36:28.770
You know, you were unconscious
for two days straight.

00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:35.193
I know you were concerned.

00:36:36.486 --> 00:36:38.739
You need hospital care.
I'll find a safe one for you.

00:36:38.822 --> 00:36:40.365
Actually, I'm totally fine.

00:36:40.449 --> 00:36:43.493
All that sleep must've worked wonders.
I do feel a lot better.

00:36:47.331 --> 00:36:48.540
I think you should know

00:36:49.791 --> 00:36:52.669
I really wish you would
take better care of yourself.

[soft music playing]

00:36:55.547 --> 00:36:57.674

Uh…

00:37:02.846 --> 00:37:04.348
All right, I hear you.

00:37:06.016 --> 00:37:08.977
But first, you're my patient.

00:37:12.606 --> 00:37:14.900
It's not that bad, don't overdo it, okay?

00:37:14.983 --> 00:37:17.861
No, no. It'll leave a scar
if we don't treat it.

00:37:17.945 --> 00:37:19.529
Let me handle it.

00:37:19.613 --> 00:37:22.532
You should know that I'm a pro at this.

00:37:24.743 --> 00:37:26.954
Anyway, you belong in a hospital
more than I do.

00:37:27.537 --> 00:37:29.164
Okay, I hear you. [Chuckles]

00:37:30.499 --> 00:37:31.500
All right.

00:37:39.633 --> 00:37:40.633
All done.

Ooh. Why are you so good at this?

00:37:48.350 --> 00:37:49.393
Well,

00:37:50.769 --> 00:37:52.270
did I ever tell you

00:37:55.857 --> 00:37:58.276
that I got beat up a lot when I was a kid?

00:37:59.653 --> 00:38:02.322
It was just that my father
was drinking a lot, you know,

00:38:02.406 --> 00:38:04.741
and so he would hit me and my mother.

00:38:06.284 --> 00:38:09.287
The only thing I was able to do for her
was stuff like this.

00:38:10.539 --> 00:38:12.249
Trying to cover her wounds…

[inhales deeply, blows]

…and doing this.

00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:20.716
It's 'cause I'm used to it. Now you know.

00:38:29.891 --> 00:38:30.891
What?

00:38:31.852 --> 00:38:34.021
It's nothing. I'm just proud of you.

00:38:36.648 --> 00:38:37.733
How about a reward?

00:38:39.735 --> 00:38:41.820
Just go get changed you goofball.

You're a mother! Han-na! Han-na!

God, I just wanna open the door!

Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Wait, did you change the passcode?

00:40:03.276 --> 00:40:06.279
Oh, God, are you all right?
Come on, let me look at you, honey.

[sobbing]

00:40:08.115 --> 00:40:10.200
Thank God you're okay.

00:40:10.283 --> 00:40:12.786
- Yeah, all right. All right. It's okay.
- Let me look at you.

00:40:12.869 --> 00:40:15.872
[gasping] What happened to your face?

00:40:15.956 --> 00:40:17.916
It's nothing. It's just a scratch.

00:40:17.999 --> 00:40:18.834
Why are you here?

00:40:18.917 --> 00:40:21.169
Han-na, my heart was pounding
when I saw the news!

00:40:21.253 --> 00:40:22.462
Of course I came running!

00:40:22.546 --> 00:40:24.381
Why on Earth weren't you
answering your phone?

00:40:24.464 --> 00:40:26.925
You scared the hell out of me!

00:40:27.008 --> 00:40:29.928
So it's just your face?
You're not hurt anywhere else?

00:40:30.011 --> 00:40:32.139
- Oh, my God, look.
- No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

00:40:32.222 --> 00:40:34.474
[Han-na] I said I'm fine,
so calm down, okay?

00:40:34.558 --> 00:40:36.726
[Gyeong-suk] No, honey, you're not fine!

Oh, no.

Why is your face so hot?

What? It's not hot. Mom, it's like always.

00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:48.822
Oh, wait, just a minute.
Oh God, what do I do?

- Oh, maybe I can just...
- [Han-na groaning]

Oh, no, honey! Are you okay? What's wrong?
Are you in pain? What's going on, honey?

00:40:55.287 --> 00:40:57.974
I've just got a bit of a headache.
I don't think I'm feeling too well.

Oh dear, where does it hurt?
I'm so worried.

00:40:59.958 --> 00:41:01.644
- Oh, God. Oh, God.
- Would you just help me get to my room?

00:41:01.668 --> 00:41:03.521
- If you could?
- All right, hold on to me, hold on to me.

00:41:03.545 --> 00:41:05.463
I'll bring you there.
That's it, very good.

00:41:05.547 --> 00:41:08.133
Good, lean on me, that's it,
we're slowly getting there.

00:41:08.216 --> 00:41:11.136
What's your dad doing up there
if he's not protecting you?

00:41:11.219 --> 00:41:15.056
Oh, dear God.
I can't believe this is happening.

00:41:23.106 --> 00:41:24.399
Ugh, seriously?

Geez.

- [cooing, giggling]

Aren't you home? I think you are, right?

Could you just let me in, please?
Come on, Jong-hyeon?

So let me ask you a question.

00:43:32.902 --> 00:43:35.030
When'd you start hating me?
I always wondered.

00:43:35.613 --> 00:43:36.614
From the start.

00:43:38.199 --> 00:43:39.284
Why?

00:43:41.661 --> 00:43:43.163
I didn't like how you smiled.

- [Jong-hyeon] <i>Yoon Dong-ju?</i>
- [friend] Yeah. Do you know him?

00:43:47.417 --> 00:43:49.669
That crazy boxer
who just made the national team.

00:43:49.753 --> 00:43:51.314
Apparently, he's hooked
on the superstition

00:43:51.338 --> 00:43:53.882
that if you run 100 laps here,
you'll win gold.

00:43:53.965 --> 00:43:56.926
Man, the guy's been going for a week,
every single day.

00:43:57.010 --> 00:43:59.220
I guess no one's been able
to go past lap 94,

00:43:59.304 --> 00:44:01.431
but I think he's gonna make it to 100.

00:44:01.514 --> 00:44:03.308
He's already on lap 99.

00:44:03.391 --> 00:44:04.934
VICTORY GYM
I AM KING

00:44:07.562 --> 00:44:09.773
Look at that sweat, my God.
Dong-ju, let's get it!

00:44:09.856 --> 00:44:12.776
- Come on, Yoon, almost there!
- [crowd cheering]

00:44:12.859 --> 00:44:14.778
Wow! Yoon Dong-ju, you've got it!

00:44:14.861 --> 00:44:16.279
[cheering continues]

00:44:22.869 --> 00:44:24.996
Let's go! Yeah!

00:44:31.127 --> 00:44:33.213
SOAR TOWARD VICTORY
TEAM KOREA

00:44:34.255 --> 00:44:35.590
- See you later.
- All right.

00:44:36.257 --> 00:44:40.470
Wow, that's really impressive.
He's killing it, man.

00:44:56.319 --> 00:44:58.947
I didn't like your smile,
and I still don't.

00:45:02.075 --> 00:45:03.910
Well, you're not my favorite either.

00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:07.247
Just go to sleep.

00:45:20.552 --> 00:45:21.636
Good night.

00:45:30.103 --> 00:45:32.105
[Dong-ju vomiting, coughing]

00:45:41.197 --> 00:45:42.407
[water running]

00:45:43.158 --> 00:45:44.868
[retches, spits]

00:45:45.493 --> 00:45:46.494
[gasps]

00:45:48.371 --> 00:45:49.372
[groans, winces]

00:45:54.711 --> 00:45:55.795
[toilet flushes]

00:45:56.838 --> 00:45:57.839
[groans]

00:46:04.846 --> 00:46:06.723
So we still don't where Min Ju-yeong is?

00:46:06.806 --> 00:46:07.682
Nah.

00:46:07.765 --> 00:46:10.810
Traffic cams got those Russian Mafia guys
escaping from the scene,

00:46:10.894 --> 00:46:12.770
as well as those Korean-Chinese guys,

00:46:13.313 --> 00:46:15.857
but how the Hell did Min Ju-yeong get out?
Nobody knows.

00:46:16.733 --> 00:46:20.528
The way out of Goldengate Central
is that way. No one can get around it.

00:46:21.654 --> 00:46:23.740
There's no shot at escaping from here

00:46:23.823 --> 00:46:26.034
if someone didn't have
an inside connection.

00:46:26.117 --> 00:46:29.704
[sighs] Yeah, we need to find out
who that mole is, for real.

00:46:31.706 --> 00:46:33.684
There's some good news,
we seized a truck yesterday.

00:46:33.708 --> 00:46:35.418
And it belongs to our man Oh Jong-go.

00:46:36.085 --> 00:46:37.605
The other trucks showed up on camera too,

00:46:37.629 --> 00:46:40.173
but their plates were unreadable,
unfortunately.

00:46:40.256 --> 00:46:42.634
Looks like they were all used
to transport Candy.

00:46:43.259 --> 00:46:45.428
That's great work.
Can you send me these photos?

00:46:45.512 --> 00:46:48.056
- We can handle it and go after Jong-Gu.
- Sure thing.

00:46:50.975 --> 00:46:53.811
By the way,
is everything all right with those two?

00:46:55.730 --> 00:46:56.981
[wind whistling]

00:46:58.650 --> 00:47:02.570
Did you stay up all night
because of the... the thing with Jeong-a?

00:47:04.197 --> 00:47:05.657
My daughter's…

00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:09.744
- Not pregnant.
- [gasps]

00:47:09.827 --> 00:47:10.828
Oh!

00:47:11.788 --> 00:47:14.040
Oh, thank God. I was so worried.
[chuckling]

00:47:14.123 --> 00:47:16.709
My wife, she's the one who's pregnant.

00:47:16.793 --> 00:47:18.586
Ah, your wife… Wait?

00:47:19.170 --> 00:47:21.714
[laughs] Congratulations!

00:47:22.465 --> 00:47:25.343
Oh wow, I didn't know you even
still had it in you, sir.

00:47:25.426 --> 00:47:28.471
I guess you've been eating well
without us, huh? [Laughing]

00:47:30.890 --> 00:47:32.767
It's not my kid.

00:47:32.850 --> 00:47:34.269
[laughing stops]

00:47:34.352 --> 00:47:35.352
I'm snipped.

00:47:36.729 --> 00:47:37.772
Uh…

00:47:38.565 --> 00:47:41.067
Yeah, but she would have
to cheat for that... [gasps]

00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:49.284
[wailing] My heart's been broken!
She's gone with the wind!

00:47:49.367 --> 00:47:50.535
Gone, forever!

00:47:50.618 --> 00:47:52.161
- [Jong-hyeon] Let's go.
- [wailing]

00:47:52.245 --> 00:47:55.331
Kim, I'll ride with you, okay?
Uh, why won't this thing open? Hey!

00:47:55.415 --> 00:47:57.166
Kim, don't you leave me, please!

00:47:57.250 --> 00:47:59.669
INSUNG METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

00:47:59.752 --> 00:48:01.462
Well, you're right on time.

00:48:07.343 --> 00:48:10.513
- I'm grateful you let me borrow your car.
- And what else?

00:48:10.597 --> 00:48:14.309
[chuckles] And also,
I'm grateful for everything you've done.

00:48:15.393 --> 00:48:18.372
So I'm supposed to help you again?
There has to be somebody else you can ask.

00:48:18.396 --> 00:48:20.106
Well, there is no one, I'm sorry.

00:48:20.189 --> 00:48:23.151
You're the only person
who will even speak to me in here.

00:48:23.234 --> 00:48:24.819
Okay, so what?

00:48:24.902 --> 00:48:26.904
And so I should just do this for you? Why?

00:48:26.988 --> 00:48:28.531
You like me, that's one reason.

00:48:28.615 --> 00:48:31.159
You think that?
I'm sorry, but you're mistaken!

00:48:31.242 --> 00:48:33.828
All right, even if I'm mistaken,
I need your help.

00:48:33.911 --> 00:48:36.497
I'm all out of people I'm able to trust.

00:48:37.081 --> 00:48:39.626
And I'm sorry. All of this is my fault.

00:48:39.709 --> 00:48:41.169
Don't sweat it, okay?

00:48:42.086 --> 00:48:44.047
I'm gonna just get comfortable
and watch TV

00:48:44.130 --> 00:48:46.215
for the next three months. [Chuckles]

00:48:46.299 --> 00:48:47.300
Ah.

00:48:50.637 --> 00:48:53.348
I couldn't just walk out
without picking this up for you.

00:48:55.141 --> 00:48:58.936
It's everyone who was present at
the joint task force launch ceremony.

00:48:59.646 --> 00:49:01.522
Could be useful for your investigation.

00:49:02.106 --> 00:49:04.275
[sighs] Why would you do all this?

00:49:05.610 --> 00:49:08.321
Well, you were right about it.
Yes, I like you.

00:49:11.699 --> 00:49:13.743
Now you know. But really…

00:49:14.494 --> 00:49:16.162
I've also been a little jealous.

00:49:16.663 --> 00:49:18.331
I always had that dream you know.

00:49:18.414 --> 00:49:21.751
To get a chance to be a badass
out there in the field. [Laughs]

00:49:22.502 --> 00:49:24.796
I'm living my dream vicariously
through you.

00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:26.381
Yeah, it's like…

00:49:28.341 --> 00:49:29.967
You're some big TV star

00:49:30.051 --> 00:49:33.137
and all I can think is,
"I wanna be like her!" [chuckles]

00:49:33.638 --> 00:49:34.639
[chuckles]

00:49:36.933 --> 00:49:40.520
J9 SECURITY

00:49:40.603 --> 00:49:41.854
Ah, shit.

00:49:41.938 --> 00:49:43.856
Everything's already been cleared out.

00:49:52.907 --> 00:49:54.283
[Man-sik] Is he here?

00:49:54.367 --> 00:49:55.952
Seems like it's been empty for a while.

00:49:56.035 --> 00:49:57.620
Even the power's been cut.

00:49:57.704 --> 00:49:59.038
[Man-sik groans] These bastards.

00:50:04.043 --> 00:50:05.253
[sighs]

00:50:05.336 --> 00:50:06.656
These aren't the right ones here.

00:50:06.713 --> 00:50:08.393
The plates don't match
any of these trucks.

00:50:08.464 --> 00:50:10.174
And the containers don't match either.

00:50:10.675 --> 00:50:12.510
Sir, I called the district office,

00:50:12.593 --> 00:50:14.804
they told me about some junkyard
that deals specifically

00:50:14.887 --> 00:50:16.973
with cargo truck deregistration
and replacements.

00:50:17.056 --> 00:50:20.727
I think Oh used plates from trucks
that had been illegally deregistered.

00:50:21.686 --> 00:50:23.312
All right, let's go have a look.

00:50:27.942 --> 00:50:30.254
- You want it? How much do you want it?
- Ooh, I want it all.

00:50:30.278 --> 00:50:31.988
- [giggles]
- Hello, Mr. Lee Yong-ju.

00:50:32.905 --> 00:50:34.741
- What the hell? Ah, shit.
- Oh!

00:50:36.033 --> 00:50:37.034
Oh.

00:50:38.202 --> 00:50:39.537
That's 'cause he took the train.

00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:41.664
She was with Oh Jong-go.
She's the bookkeeper.

00:50:41.748 --> 00:50:42.749
Ah.

00:50:43.332 --> 00:50:45.626
Who are they? Your father and brother?

00:50:49.005 --> 00:50:50.298
[whispers] They're police.

00:50:52.550 --> 00:50:53.718
Ah, shit.

00:50:53.801 --> 00:50:55.470
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:50:55.553 --> 00:50:56.971
[quirky music playing]

00:50:57.054 --> 00:50:58.055
[grunts]

00:50:59.515 --> 00:51:02.018
[grunts] Shit. Shit.

00:51:03.811 --> 00:51:04.872
- Ooh. Whoa.
- [Yong-ju] Damn it.

00:51:04.896 --> 00:51:06.647
What, you got somewhere to be?
I wanna know.

00:51:10.193 --> 00:51:12.779
- [exclaims] Damn it.
- [grunts]

00:51:13.863 --> 00:51:15.323
- [groans]
- [thuds]

00:51:15.406 --> 00:51:16.866
Oh, shit.

00:51:16.949 --> 00:51:18.242
- [Yong-ju] Look at this.
- Oh?

00:51:18.326 --> 00:51:20.077
Ah, just put it down.

00:51:20.620 --> 00:51:22.121
Go on.

00:51:24.123 --> 00:51:26.167
[yelps]

00:51:26.250 --> 00:51:29.420
Look, we know you've been selling
Mr. Oh plates for his cargo trucks.

00:51:29.504 --> 00:51:31.172
And I want those plate numbers.

00:51:31.255 --> 00:51:32.757
Dude, I don't know.

00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:33.841
I've got tons of clients.

00:51:33.925 --> 00:51:36.385
There's so many plates I've put on
hundreds of trucks.

00:51:36.469 --> 00:51:37.696
You might as well just arrest me.

00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:39.806
I'll pay a fine and be done with it.

00:51:40.389 --> 00:51:41.641
You came all this way for this?

00:51:41.724 --> 00:51:43.702
Just to embarrass me
over this nonsense. Seriously?

00:51:43.726 --> 00:51:45.353
Come on. Arrest me. [Grunts]

00:51:45.436 --> 00:51:46.854
Just arrest me.

00:51:48.397 --> 00:51:49.398
Wait a minute.

00:51:50.107 --> 00:51:51.526
That a photo of your daughter?

00:51:53.444 --> 00:51:55.071
-Yeah
-Oh, so you're married?

00:51:55.696 --> 00:51:56.697
Yeah.

00:51:57.323 --> 00:51:59.075
You're married but you're here just…

00:51:59.158 --> 00:52:02.745
You're here messing around
with another woman? [Cries]

00:52:02.829 --> 00:52:04.890
- You're being unfaithful!
- I feel like he's about to lose it.

00:52:04.914 --> 00:52:07.458
- This is bad.
- Excuse me. I can help with that.

00:52:08.042 --> 00:52:09.252
[grunts]

00:52:10.378 --> 00:52:14.423
These are the records for the cargo trucks
Mr. Oh manages personally.

00:52:15.716 --> 00:52:17.927
[Man-sik] There are
about 15 illegal trucks in total.

00:52:18.427 --> 00:52:21.889
Uh… They transported the Candy
in seven trucks.

00:52:21.973 --> 00:52:23.558
These ones here.

00:52:23.641 --> 00:52:27.061
[sighs] I wonder where the hell
would Oh Jong-go be hiding?

00:52:27.144 --> 00:52:28.824
Min Ju-yeong is never
letting the Candy go.

00:52:28.855 --> 00:52:30.940
Okay. So if we follow the drug,

00:52:31.023 --> 00:52:32.984
we will eventually get to both of them.

00:52:33.526 --> 00:52:36.529
CCTV footage should help us
track down the trucks one by one.

00:52:36.612 --> 00:52:39.866
All right. I guess now it's back
to legwork, huh?

00:52:39.949 --> 00:52:41.509
[Jong-hyeon] I'll take a photo of this.

00:52:41.534 --> 00:52:42.869
- [Man-sik] Okay.
- [shutter clicks]

00:52:43.870 --> 00:52:45.079
All right.

00:52:45.162 --> 00:52:46.998
Let's split into two teams.

00:52:47.081 --> 00:52:49.625
And you, you're gonna stay
right where you are.

00:52:49.709 --> 00:52:50.710
What? Why?

00:52:50.793 --> 00:52:53.880
Why? You gotta be kidding me?
You know you're a wanted man, right?

00:52:53.963 --> 00:52:56.149
If someone spots you
and things go south, we're screwed.

00:52:56.173 --> 00:52:57.258
[sighs] Come on.

00:52:57.758 --> 00:53:03.431
Yeah, sure. Obviously it's hard to go
unnoticed with a pretty face like mine.

00:53:04.098 --> 00:53:05.641
But why can't I be incognito?

00:53:05.725 --> 00:53:07.268
That's impossible and you know it.

00:53:07.351 --> 00:53:09.329
You're gonna stay here, punk.
And just keep me posted.

00:53:09.353 --> 00:53:11.513
- Keep you posted. Come on.
- [Jong-hyeon] I'll take him.

00:53:12.565 --> 00:53:14.365
It's riskier for us
to leave him alone anyway.

00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:15.902
- [Man-sik] You sure?
- [scoffs]

00:53:15.985 --> 00:53:17.320
[Man-sik] You got a point.

00:53:17.403 --> 00:53:19.155
All right, take him with you.

00:53:19.238 --> 00:53:22.408
If he does screw up,
better if you're there when it happens.

00:53:22.491 --> 00:53:24.285
What do you think I am, huh? A child?

00:53:24.368 --> 00:53:27.204
You're worse than a child, idiot!
You're a goddamn fugitive.

00:53:27.288 --> 00:53:29.040
Quit whining and go, or stay put.

00:53:29.123 --> 00:53:30.499
Yeah, man. Come on.

00:53:34.295 --> 00:53:35.296
[Man-sik] Whoa, hang on.

00:53:35.379 --> 00:53:37.757
Kim, I just realized
you're not wearing your glasses.

00:53:38.341 --> 00:53:41.093
I mean, you look a lot better
without them. Almost as good as me.

00:53:41.177 --> 00:53:43.095
[Jae-Hong] You're right.
He does look better.

00:53:44.013 --> 00:53:46.491
What are you talking about?
It's the same dumb face. Well, come on.

00:53:46.515 --> 00:53:47.659
[Gwang-se] You're both good-looking!

00:53:47.683 --> 00:53:51.520
[yelps] Why are you doing this, huh?
[screaming]

00:53:54.148 --> 00:53:56.108
- [high-pitched ringing]
- [person groans]

00:53:56.192 --> 00:53:58.611
- I bought the plate from him too.
- [ringing fades]

00:53:58.694 --> 00:54:00.404
I've never even met Oh Jong-go!

00:54:00.488 --> 00:54:02.365
Well, if you've never met him,
why did you run?

00:54:02.448 --> 00:54:04.408
- I ran 'cause you told me you were cops!
- [sighs]

00:54:05.034 --> 00:54:06.702
[Jong-hyeon] Let me see the plate.

00:54:07.620 --> 00:54:09.747
I was scammed into buying it
a few days ago.

00:54:10.247 --> 00:54:11.540
I'm the victim here, all right?

00:54:12.416 --> 00:54:13.769
- Here it is.
- [Jong-hyeon] All right.

00:54:13.793 --> 00:54:14.961
Thanks for cooperating.

00:54:15.753 --> 00:54:16.837
- Geez.
- [sighs]

00:54:19.924 --> 00:54:20.925
What did he say?

00:54:21.634 --> 00:54:24.095
A few days ago he said
he was scammed into buying the plate.

00:54:25.763 --> 00:54:26.764
[sighs]

00:54:27.348 --> 00:54:29.058
If you feel tired, you should rest.

00:54:29.141 --> 00:54:30.601
I'll check out the rest on my own.

00:54:31.227 --> 00:54:33.020
Tired? What are you talking about?

00:54:33.104 --> 00:54:35.147
I'm made of steel, unlike someone I know.

00:54:36.774 --> 00:54:39.902
Just stay here, okay? You'll just
get in the way so take it easy.

00:54:41.862 --> 00:54:43.155
I see.

00:54:43.239 --> 00:54:46.826
Look, if you hate to be around me so much,
why'd you decide to bring me?

00:54:48.786 --> 00:54:50.037
'Cause it annoyed me.

00:54:50.538 --> 00:54:51.539
What?

00:54:53.958 --> 00:54:55.209
Han-na and I hanging out?

00:54:56.669 --> 00:54:57.837
Yeah.

00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:02.133
[sighs]

00:55:02.216 --> 00:55:03.342
[Dong-ju scoffs]

00:55:04.885 --> 00:55:06.012
Geez.

00:55:06.095 --> 00:55:08.848
Just started to like the guy,
and he ruins it.

00:55:09.515 --> 00:55:10.516
[sighs]

00:55:12.101 --> 00:55:13.644
[Dong-ju retches, vomits]

00:55:14.311 --> 00:55:15.688
[coughs, gags]

00:55:24.196 --> 00:55:25.197
[sighs]

00:55:26.157 --> 00:55:27.283
[phone buzzes]

00:55:29.035 --> 00:55:30.036
Chief, what's up?

00:55:31.037 --> 00:55:32.038
INSUNG JEIL ELECTRONICS

00:55:32.121 --> 00:55:34.933
[forensics chief] <i>There are too many eyes</i>
<i>at the agency, so I did it here.</i>

00:55:34.957 --> 00:55:36.876
It's my brother's shop so don't worry.

00:55:37.793 --> 00:55:38.794
All right.

00:55:43.090 --> 00:55:44.925
- [Han-na] Hello, sir.
- [chuckles]

00:55:45.009 --> 00:55:46.719
Well, the phone was pretty busted

00:55:46.802 --> 00:55:49.096
but I was able to recover
half of what was on there.

00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:50.264
That's wonderful.

00:55:54.393 --> 00:55:56.233
[Man-sik] What's the number
from the last call?

00:55:57.021 --> 00:55:59.899
Hmm? Four, seven, two, three? That's, um…

00:56:01.108 --> 00:56:02.735
Just hold on. Uh…

00:56:02.818 --> 00:56:04.487
Wait, do you know that number?

00:56:09.700 --> 00:56:10.910
LEE JONG-HUN

00:56:10.993 --> 00:56:12.161
[line ringing]

00:56:14.497 --> 00:56:16.123
[Man-sik] Wait, Lee Jong-hun?

00:56:16.707 --> 00:56:18.709
Who's that? Sounds familiar.

00:56:21.128 --> 00:56:22.588
The rookie over at RIU.

00:56:27.343 --> 00:56:29.804
Wait a minute.
It's starting to make sense.

00:56:30.513 --> 00:56:32.014
When Dong-ju was taken,

00:56:32.098 --> 00:56:34.183
RIU were the only ones
I forwarded the location to.

00:56:34.266 --> 00:56:36.560
Oh Jong-go just showing up
there was strange.

00:56:36.644 --> 00:56:39.730
Do you think Drug Demon taking his gun
was part of it all?

00:56:39.814 --> 00:56:41.273
That is was intentional.

00:56:41.357 --> 00:56:43.776
Who knows?
Could have been arranged like that.

00:56:43.859 --> 00:56:45.861
What we do know is this guy's our mole.

00:56:45.945 --> 00:56:47.947
Now it's all starting to make sense.

00:56:48.614 --> 00:56:49.657
Yeah, of course.

00:56:50.699 --> 00:56:53.202
When Drug Demon escaped,
he was the one watching her.

00:56:53.285 --> 00:56:56.705
I went to the bathroom for a second,
and when I got back, she was gone.

00:57:00.501 --> 00:57:01.710
[sighs] Jesus.

00:57:02.711 --> 00:57:04.213
- [Man-sik] <i>Hey, Dae-yong.</i>
- Yeah?

00:57:04.296 --> 00:57:06.715
- <i>You with the rookie right now?</i>
- You mean Jong-hun?

00:57:06.799 --> 00:57:09.969
He's on disciplinary leave
for losing his firearm to Drug Demon.

00:57:10.052 --> 00:57:11.679
Why? What's up?

00:57:14.014 --> 00:57:16.392
[Man-sik] All right.
We finally found the mole.

00:57:16.475 --> 00:57:18.435
Now all that's left
is to catch Min Ju-yeong.

00:57:18.519 --> 00:57:19.520
[police sirens wailing]

00:57:19.603 --> 00:57:22.481
Damn, look at that. What a spectacle.

00:57:23.315 --> 00:57:27.236
Over 500 officers have been dispatched
ordered by the commissioner himself.

00:57:27.820 --> 00:57:30.656
I heard through the grapevine
that he's sleeping at the agency.

00:57:31.824 --> 00:57:34.201
[Man-sik] Hell of a thing,
switching sides like that.

00:57:34.285 --> 00:57:35.995
Yeah, changed his tune pretty fast.

00:57:36.579 --> 00:57:38.455
The man is nervous.
The tables have turned.

00:57:38.539 --> 00:57:40.666
Now where's that bastard
Min Ju-yeong hiding?

00:57:40.749 --> 00:57:43.669
All these people tearing the city apart
and not even a glimpse of him?

00:57:43.752 --> 00:57:44.962
Son of a bitch.

00:57:54.597 --> 00:57:55.681
[phone buzzing]

00:57:56.974 --> 00:57:58.642
Hey, Dae-yong. Where's your rookie?

00:58:03.564 --> 00:58:07.067
[tense music playing]

00:58:07.151 --> 00:58:09.445
[sirens wailing]

00:58:12.156 --> 00:58:14.950
[officer crying] No, it can't be.

00:58:15.034 --> 00:58:17.036
- Hey.
- [officer] What the hell is this, man?

00:58:17.119 --> 00:58:18.597
- What the hell happened to him?
- [officer crying]

00:58:18.621 --> 00:58:19.830
[Dae-yong] I don't know.

00:58:19.914 --> 00:58:21.749
We were called out here too.

00:58:21.832 --> 00:58:25.127
Jong-hun is not that kind of man.
Something's off here.

00:58:25.211 --> 00:58:28.464
- [officer crying] Oh, God.
- [officer 2] Jong-hun!

00:58:43.103 --> 00:58:45.105
Min Ju-yeong couldn't have
escaped so easily

00:58:45.648 --> 00:58:47.900
and make it
out of Goldengate Central unseen.

00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:51.070
[sighs] All of the firefighters
and officers.

00:58:51.779 --> 00:58:52.780
God.

00:58:53.364 --> 00:58:55.115
How in the world did he get out?

00:59:01.538 --> 00:59:03.874
[Jong-hyeon] <i>Over 500 officers</i>

Hell of a thing,

I heard through the grapevine

[Dong-ju] <i>You goddamn coward.</i>

00:59:19.598 --> 00:59:22.559
Min Ju-yeong, I think I know where he is.

<i>Guys like him when they sense danger,</i>

00:59:27.189 --> 00:59:30.234

00:59:31.277 --> 00:59:33.779
<i>Right next to the biggest guy in the room.</i>

00:59:36.657 --> 00:59:38.033
Did you speak to the mayor yet?

00:59:38.659 --> 00:59:39.660
[Pan-yeol] Ah, yes.

00:59:39.743 --> 00:59:43.080
He said he will…
He'll have someone come over soon.

00:59:46.583 --> 00:59:48.752
Can I offer you some tea perhaps?

00:59:48.836 --> 00:59:50.629
I have quality green tea.
