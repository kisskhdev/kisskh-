00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.560
Rin, have you found out

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.440
who Prapai's new lover is?

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.160
Do you know that

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.440
you're a very disgusting man?

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:20.840
Khem.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:22.520
I need your help.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.760
Ouch! Ow!

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.920
That means you were harassed.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.140
I'd like to review the CCTV footage
of the empty floor

00:00:30.165 --> 00:00:33.400
The security cameras around
the perimeter are under maintenance.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.280
How did you get out?

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.000
Thankfully, I had my phone with me.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.440
Gee, do you know who did it?

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:10.680
Hey, Khem.

00:01:11.983 --> 00:01:12.863
Yes?

00:01:13.208 --> 00:01:14.568
After passing the trial,

00:01:14.608 --> 00:01:15.808
shall we go and celebrate?

00:01:19.135 --> 00:01:20.895
I don't know if...

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.548
I'm going to pass the trial period, right?

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.600
It seems like Boss wants me to fail.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.680
Hold on.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.920
It's the two of us
who will evaluate your performance

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.405
along with the head of the department.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.600
Boss is not involved in the evaluation,

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.160
and that has always been the case.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.680
But...

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.280
I always have to submit
my assignments to her,

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.720
and I end up redoing so much of the work.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.280
Um...

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.080
I have no clue about this one.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.320
Maybe she's making changes to the policy.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.480
If that's the case,

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.360
maybe ask her about it
when you submit your next assignment.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.680
Right.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.840
Ow!

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.160
Are you alright?

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.760
Out of the way.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.640
Gosh...

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:50.920
That hurt.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:00.760
Uh...

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.400
Jay and Balloon,

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.440
I'd like to have lunch at the garden area.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.920
I have to sort some stuff out with someone.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.200
Suit yourself, then.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.200
It's more comfortable dining indoors,
am I right?

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.520
Definitely.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.120
Right.

00:03:25.335 --> 00:03:26.200
Hey!

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.880
Huh?

00:03:26.905 --> 00:03:28.785
Don't hit on each other
when nobody's around, okay?

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:30.520
Nuts!

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.320
That's ridiculous!

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.640
God is going to smite us all.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.560
Bam!

00:03:38.584 --> 00:03:39.600
Hey!

00:03:39.824 --> 00:03:41.424
You crazy girl.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.440
Come in.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.080
Hello, my dear wife!

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.280
Hey.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.840
Why are you still coming here
to have lunch with me?

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.280
I told you to be here after lunch,
didn't I?

00:05:20.263 --> 00:05:22.503
I'm not here to have lunch.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.040
I'm here to have you.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.600
You...

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.280
That's out of line!

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.320
Here you go.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.720
It's a cup of iced chocolate.

00:05:37.535 --> 00:05:39.095
It's extremely rich.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.120
Maybe it can give my dear CEO a boost.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.160
Mm. Thanks.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.080
Uh...

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.680
Can I have lunch with you?

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.360
Mm.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.240
Which one would you like to have?

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.520
This one

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.560
or this one?

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.240
Hey.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.000
Finish your lunch already.

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.320
After you're done,

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.480
we'll get to the important matter.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.280
It's about the performance evaluation.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:44.393
I think...

00:06:48.606 --> 00:06:49.800
What?!

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.560
What's with you?

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.120
It's...

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.920
It's the cry of a pup
with its heart crushed.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.680
Rin...

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.480
Don't make it like
I've failed the evaluation.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.800
I've been trying my very best.

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:10.400
I'm sure that
my parents would be proud of me.

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:11.600
Please, Rin!

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.200
Don't do me dirty like this.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.280
Please give me a pass.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.640
Please, my beautiful lady.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:16.293
Please!

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:17.520
Mm!

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:19.800
Well...

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:22.400
I'm neither the one examining

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.480
nor evaluating you.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.520
Aside from me,

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.520
the ones you submit your work to

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.360
are responsible for the evaluation.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.320
Yay!

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.960
Yay!!

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.200
Thank you so much, Rin.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:47.000
I love you more than anything in the world.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.040
Thank you, Beautiful.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.480
You're petting me

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.320
because you adore me?

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.440
Mm. It's time for you to leave.

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:25.080
I want a rest.

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.480
You've actually fallen for me, haven't you?

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.560
Nonsense.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:46.320
I know what you feel about me.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:51.360
If you don't want me to say it,

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.520
then I won't do it to make you flustered.

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:01.560
Thank you.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:31.040
I guess you're giving in, my dear wife.

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.240
Oh, gosh...

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:11.400
I'm so full right now, Jay.

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:13.560
Yeah, the food was really good!

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.520
Are you full?

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:15.360
Definitely.

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:16.960
- Alright!
- Whoa.

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:18.640
The vibe was amazing.

00:10:18.665 --> 00:10:20.800
Yeah, the music was nice as well.

00:10:20.824 --> 00:10:22.095
- Mm.
- I love it.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.031
Right.

00:10:23.056 --> 00:10:24.360
If I have a boyfriend,

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.760
I'll take him to that place.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:29.720
Right.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:31.040
Khem.

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.000
Your wife doesn't mind you

00:10:33.025 --> 00:10:34.465
eating out like this?

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.120
I bet she's delighted.

00:10:41.145 --> 00:10:42.960
She's so stubborn.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:45.520
She never expresses what she feels.

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:49.880
By the way...

00:10:49.905 --> 00:10:51.505
About your wife, Khem...

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.920
We've actually never seen her.

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:54.840
Mm.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.160
Oh...

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:59.240
She's a very shy person.

00:11:00.225 --> 00:11:02.425
Should I be allowed
to introduce her to you,

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.720
you'll definitely get to meet her.

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:06.240
- No problem.
- Right.

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:07.520
I'm looking forward to that.

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:08.360
Right.

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:14.740
Well...

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:16.920
That's it for me.

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.840
I'll text you once I'm home, okay?

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:20.720
Mm.

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:21.840
Sure.

00:11:21.865 --> 00:11:23.145
Have a safe trip home, guys.

00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:24.064
Thank you.

00:11:24.089 --> 00:11:26.089
- Bye-bye.
- Have a good one!

Balloon.

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:40.760
Huh?

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:42.800
Want to stay at my place tonight?

00:11:42.825 --> 00:11:44.225
Want to stay at my place tonight?

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:52.040
Your...

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:54.120
Come on!

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:01.840
Let's go!

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:03.760
- This way.
- I guess I'll go.

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.640
Rin is waiting for you in the dining room.

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:34.680
Right.

00:12:35.224 --> 00:12:36.224
Follow me.

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:44.920
Come and join me.

00:12:47.735 --> 00:12:48.736
Why are you just standing there?

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:51.720
- I told you to sit down and have dinner.
- Right.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.280
You're not having anything, Rin?

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.040
I've already had mine.

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:01.840
Just enjoy your dish.

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:12.840
What is this?

00:13:12.865 --> 00:13:14.945
Why does it look a bit strange?

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:16.330
It's a vegetable stew.

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.400
Just enjoy it.

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:23.400
I asked the housemaids
to prepare it specifically for you.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.080
Really?

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:27.800
Of course.

00:13:29.556 --> 00:13:31.120
Thank you very much.

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:34.520
My dear wife is the sweetest of all.

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:37.120
Please enjoy it a whole bunch.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:40.760
This special dish is for my special one.

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.200
Hey, Khem.

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.440
Are you still awake?

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:31.880
What about it?

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:34.600
Do you want me to go to bed that badly?

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:37.169
Or are you worried about

00:14:37.194 --> 00:14:38.980
what happened on that day?

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.560
Don't worry, Rin.

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.400
I'm a tough cookie.

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:49.680
5 hours of sleep
is enough for me to get by.

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:52.160
However, if I don't get to sleep
for several days,

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:54.880
this tough cookie might actually crumble.

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.640
If you want me to sleep early,

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:01.560
you have to give me some motivation.

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:05.800
I wasn't worried about that.

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:08.920
I'm going to bed.

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:12.760
Hey!

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:16.480
I haven't done the thing, though.

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:19.680
The show's over.

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:20.860
You don't have my consent.

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:26.320
Do you really want to skip the show?

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.120
Mm.

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:32.320
I'm good at my job, though.

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:36.320
I can even amp things up if you want to.

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:43.040
I'm the top performer.

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:46.120
I won't let the show
go quiet for a single minute.

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:50.760
Are you going to reward me
for my performance?

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.960
I love you, Rin.

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:12.560
Do you want to perform with me?

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:17.960
Well, tonight,

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:22.520
I'd like to see you run the show.

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:49.320
Good morning, Dad.

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:53.240
How are you?

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:54.600
You don't look so well.

00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:57.010
You had a bad sleep last night?

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:01.960
Would you like some porridge
or a cup of coffee?

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:08.160
I'll have anything that gives me energy.

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:13.880
Um... Well...

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:15.600
Kind of.

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:19.200
You have a meeting today, don't you?

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:22.480
It's with the shareholders in the morning.

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:24.640
Your secretary
already told you that, right?

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:25.600
Mm.

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:27.710
I will not be attending, however.

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:32.340
I have something to attend to.

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:35.720
More importantly,
I want you to manage things yourself.

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:38.120
That way, when you're the president,

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.720
you won't have any doubts.

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:42.480
Right.

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:44.960
I'll do my best.

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:47.480
But I hope you don't do a turnaround

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:50.300
and give all of the inheritance to others.

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:52.320
I won't do that.

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:55.520
You're my only child,

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:57.840
so my inheritance belongs to you

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.400
as long as

00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:02.670
you meet all the conditions.

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:05.280
Understood.

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:08.160
I'll fulfill all of your conditions,

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:09.860
but...

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:12.320
I don't know, Dad.

00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:16.430
I might not live long enough to inherit.

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:18.160
She's such a troublemaker.

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:22.600
Khem might be a bit off track,

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:25.440
but not so much that you can't handle her

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:27.190
and bring her under control.

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:04.520
Oh, Mr. Wasin.

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:07.680
Is there something important
to call me about so early?

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:13.280
I'm withdrawing all my shares
from your company.

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.400
Withdraw all your shares?

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:17.040
Right now?

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:18.480
What happened?

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:21.920
Is your company facing
financial difficulties?

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.880
We can talk about this.

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:25.420
I'm always willing to help you.

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:27.160
That's not the case.

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:30.360
My company isn't struggling.

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.560
I think it's best that I no longer see you

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:36.800
and your son.

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:40.320
I don't get it.

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:42.120
What are you saying?

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:47.520
Did Kiri do something to upset Rin?

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:52.720
You know it deep down.

00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:55.880
You and your son

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:57.500
ruined my daughter's life.

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:00.360
My daughter

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:01.840
suffered,

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:03.640
cried,

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:07.720
and was heartbroken,
as if her entire world had collapsed,

00:24:09.090 --> 00:24:11.640
while you and your son
continued living happily

00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:14.780
and pulling all the strings

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:16.880
without remorse.

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:22.200
The impact on your company
is not my concern anymore.

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:24.640
I'm taking everything back.

00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:29.120
And...

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:33.040
What about the joint project
between Kiri and your company?

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:37.220
Other companies can take over the project.

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:38.240
I do not mind.

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:40.420
If you want to keep it simple,

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:42.600
I'll wrap it up as quickly as I can.

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:44.960
After that,

00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:47.670
our paths shall not cross again.

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:54.320
I do not want you and your son

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:57.440
to have any part
in my daughter's life anymore.

00:24:58.360 --> 00:24:59.760
Mark my words.

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:34.160
I'm sorry for being late.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:35.860
Right.

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:44.620
Yes?

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:45.520
Uh...

00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:47.010
Let's start the meeting.

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:49.280
Yes.

00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:52.580
This meeting's topic is overseas expansion.

00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:56.070
The international department
will present the flowchart

00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:58.650
prepared for you.

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:32.280
Okay.

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:34.840
The meeting's dismissed.

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:36.660
We'll call it here.

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:52.320
Mai.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.000
Mai!

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:07.200
Boss, you looked a bit pale
during the meeting.

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:08.660
Are you sick?

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:12.120
No.

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:14.040
I didn't get enough sleep.

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:15.560
Oh,

00:27:15.970 --> 00:27:17.570
please postpone the meeting

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:19.400
to tomorrow.

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:20.800
I'd like to rest today.

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:23.060
Understood. I'll sort it out.

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:24.720
Oh, one more thing.

00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:27.360
Do not let anyone disturb me.

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:28.480
I want to take a nap.

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:33.800
What about Khem's assignment that
needs to be submitted before the meeting?

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:36.480
Tell her that I'm not accepting it today

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:38.360
and have her submit it tomorrow instead.

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:40.880
If you want to inform her
by phone or in any other way,

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:42.260
it's up to you.

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:43.800
Understood.

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:12.440
Thank you.

00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:21.440
Khem, where are you going?

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:23.900
I'm submitting my assignment to Boss.

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:27.080
Oh, she told me that
you can submit it tomorrow.

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:28.700
She's fairly tired,

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:30.000
so she'd like to rest.

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:32.920
She was sleeping before the lunch break,

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:34.740
so she's probably still not awake.

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:40.200
Is she sick?

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:42.800
She might just be a bit exhausted.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.080
You could check up on her if you'd like,

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:47.600
but don't wake her up.

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:49.520
She might get up and overwork.

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:50.680
Oh...

00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:52.920
Thank you.

00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:52.880
You're too tired to tease me today,
aren't you?

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:09.280
How adorable.

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:51.480
If you're exhausted,

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:56.520
I promise to do our thing less often.

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:37.600
How did it get here?

00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:57.400
"Have something to eat after waking up."

00:32:58.190 --> 00:32:59.590
"By the time you wake up,

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:01.640
the coffee has probably gotten cold,

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:04.760
but I'm sure the pastry
is still as tasty as ever."

00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:06.760
"Love you with all of my heart."

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:23.440
You crazy girl.

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:25.760
You messed with me
and then tried to make up for it?

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:55.200
This is ridiculous!

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:52.440
Come in.

00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:23.500
Are you feeling better now?

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:29.880
Mm.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.360
Let's go home together.

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:36.800
Dad told me that you didn't drive here,

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.400
so let me drive us home.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.800
I was just feeling a little dizzy.

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:48.520
Maybe somebody here overdid the thing.

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:50.520
I tried to stop, but you didn't listen.

00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:52.830
On top of that,
you acted like you didn't do anything.

00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:59.840
Who would have known

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:03.800
it'd make you this unwell?

00:36:04.370 --> 00:36:06.720
Meanwhile, I'm still doing fine.

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:20.720
Is something on your mind?

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:25.400
Can you take me to a place?

00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:28.640
Sure.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.200
Gosh!

00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:41.200
I just took her to see her ex?

00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:58.440
I'll be right back.

00:36:58.480 --> 00:36:59.280
Right.

00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:06.200
Hey, you.

00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:07.580
What's up with you?

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:10.760
I'm jealous.

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:12.800
I'm jealous of my dear wife.

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:14.960
I'm jealous that my wife still has feelings
for someone else.

00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:18.440
This young pup has a heart too, you know?

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:21.120
Now that you've got this little pup,

00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:22.940
please go ahead and love her.

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:24.040
Please!

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:26.840
- Bark, bark!
- Khem!

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:31.440
Listen.

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:32.660
Quit insisting

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:34.120
and go home.

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:41.080
From now on, stop using that tone of voice.

00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:42.180
I don't like it.

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:04.520
"Stop using that tone of voice."

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:05.880
"I don't like it!"

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:08.320
- Khemjira!
- Huh?!

00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:10.640
- Yes?
- I heard the thing you just said.

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:13.920
I didn't say anything.

00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:16.200
It must've been the wind.

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:20.880
Rin! Wait for me!

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:22.400
Rin!

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:45.560
Shall we do our thing?

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:48.120
No.

00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:52.320
Why not?

00:38:54.384 --> 00:38:55.944
I'm on my period.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:58.880
And...

00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:00.920
Did you take the medicine?

00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:43.120
Here's your medicine.

00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:51.160
For me?

00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:53.680
That's right.

00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:56.440
If you haven't had it, then go ahead.

00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:58.320
The pain will go away.

00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:22.960
Here you go.

00:40:22.985 --> 00:40:24.985
Use the hot water bag, too, okay?

00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:33.320
I'll take care of you.

00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:38.800
It's just the menstrual cycle.

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:40.960
I'm not on my deathbed.

00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:43.320
Come on!

00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:45.920
You know nothing, do you?

00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:47.720
If my wife's in pain,

00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:50.520
then so am I.

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:55.240
Thanks.

00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:04.280
Have a rest.

00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:47.040
Khem, are you sleepy?

00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:50.440
Not yet.

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:52.800
I'm waiting for you to fall asleep.

00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:05.360
Easy, Rin.

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:09.560
Khem.

00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:10.960
Yes?

00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:16.720
I think we need to talk

00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:18.840
about you doing your thing.

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:21.840
Why?

00:42:21.865 --> 00:42:23.625
I didn't do too well?

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:27.240
No.

00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:29.560
I...

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:31.360
I need a break.

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:33.720
Sometimes, I get exhausted.

00:42:34.375 --> 00:42:35.220
You...

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.400
You need to let me sleep before 11 P.M.

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:40.800
Every time you do it to me,

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:43.000
it's always more than five sessions.

00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:45.240
It takes a lot of time at night.

00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:47.880
But every time I do it,

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:50.360
you're happy, aren't you?

00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:53.120
- You also told me to do it harder, too.
- Well...

00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:56.840
At that rate, we can't stop, can we?

00:42:57.880 --> 00:42:59.920
The thing is, you shouldn't start.

00:43:01.136 --> 00:43:04.180
When will you let me do it?

00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:07.120
I want to do it every day,

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.680
both before bed

00:43:09.897 --> 00:43:11.497
and after waking up.

00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:18.240
How about this?

00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:22.160
We'll do it 3 times a week,

00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:24.160
every other day.

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:25.360
Okay?

00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:28.000
Can we do it outdoors?

00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:36.000
Um...

00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:41.840
It depends on the case.

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:44.320
Don't do anything weird.

00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:46.680
If I say no,

00:43:46.705 --> 00:43:47.705
you have to stop,

00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:48.952
no complaints,

00:43:48.977 --> 00:43:50.377
and no being headstrong.

00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:52.040
Okay.

00:43:52.065 --> 00:43:53.465
Okay, Rin.

00:43:53.912 --> 00:43:56.912
I'll listen to whatever you say.

00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:00.320
During the lunch break,

00:44:00.345 --> 00:44:02.800
can I have lunch with you?

00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:04.782
Do you allow it?

00:44:08.184 --> 00:44:09.424
That's up to you.

00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:10.600
However,

00:44:10.895 --> 00:44:13.055
I'll never prepare lunch for you.

00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:16.460
That's totally fine.

00:44:19.992 --> 00:44:22.192
For now, please have a rest.

00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:31.080
Have a good rest.

00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:32.920
Here.

00:46:17.474 --> 00:46:18.920
Did you know that the job you're doing

00:46:18.945 --> 00:46:20.545
was previously held by my partner?

00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:23.320
You must've been in bliss,

00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:25.020
stealing someone else's job.

00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:30.240
You mean the one who got fired
before I came in?

00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:34.200
My partner got fired without any reason

00:46:34.250 --> 00:46:36.360
but didn't press charges
because I'm still working here.

00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:38.840
I don't know why,

00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:41.160
but maybe you do,

00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:43.520
since this company

00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:45.680
is rife with nepotism.

00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:49.680
If you want to know the truth so badly,

00:46:49.705 --> 00:46:51.545
why don't you ask the HR department

00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:53.880
about the reasons behind the layoff?

00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:59.265
I think your partner's lying to you,

00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:02.440
and you're going after the wrong person.

00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:07.520
I saw you and Boss
at the parking lot the other day.

00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:12.000
You must be pretty good at
bootlicking the higher-ups.

00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:14.760
First, it was Ms. Maturot,

00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:17.000
and now you're going after Boss?

00:47:19.664 --> 00:47:22.664
No wonder you were able to come in
and take other people's jobs,

00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:25.080
even though the company
wasn't accepting new employees.

00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:28.720
There's no need for me to do that.

00:47:29.711 --> 00:47:31.911
No one wants to talk about
this kind of thing.

00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:39.840
If that's what you think of me,

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.640
why not think about this
in a different light?

00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:44.000
The reason behind the layoff

00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:47.040
might be that your partner
bootlicked the wrong person.

00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:50.520
And nobody really wants to talk about
this kind of thing.

00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:58.000
Ah!

00:47:58.400 --> 00:47:59.040
Ouch!

00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:00.880
Ah! Khem!

00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:02.000
Oh?!

00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:03.640
It was so obvious that

00:48:03.665 --> 00:48:05.665
Gee intentionally tripped Khem.

00:48:05.695 --> 00:48:06.575
Hey, Hong!

00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:09.001
She tripped on her own.
I didn't do anything.

00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:16.760
You stupid girl.

00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:17.920
You dare slap me?

00:48:17.945 --> 00:48:19.265
I was just teaching you a lesson.

00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:21.120
If you don't quit acting childish

00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:22.680
and falsely accusing others,

00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:24.680
I'll slap you so hard
it'll ruin your fillers

00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:26.480
and break your surgically altered nose,

00:48:26.505 --> 00:48:27.785
you rabid dog!

00:48:27.810 --> 00:48:28.690
You!

00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:30.200
What?

00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:39.800
Khem.

00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:42.960
I think we should take you to the hospital.

00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:48.040
Ah!

00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:50.000
Please stop fighting.

00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:51.400
Let's take you to the hospital.

00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:52.680
Let's go.

00:48:58.400 --> 00:48:59.880
Spicy!

00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:10.480
Come in.

00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:14.240
Mai?

00:49:15.471 --> 00:49:16.391
Where's Khem?

00:49:16.655 --> 00:49:18.175
Her assignment is now overdue.

00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:22.040
I'm here to tell you that

00:49:22.065 --> 00:49:23.855
Khem has been injured.

00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:26.640
She's currently
at the company's medical facility.

00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:36.880
Hold on...

00:49:38.115 --> 00:49:40.000
What? What do you mean?

00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:41.320
What happened?

00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:45.440
Something happened, and she blacked out.

00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:47.920
What?

00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:48.840
She blacked out?

00:49:55.200 --> 00:50:00.200
[Director:
Thanamin Wongsakulpach]

00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:03.480
I said that I didn't love her.

00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:07.200
I don't know

00:50:09.463 --> 00:50:11.463
if I've been lying to her

00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:14.560
or to myself.

00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:22.280
Why did I say that,

00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:25.257
even though hugging

00:50:25.576 --> 00:50:26.576
and kissing her

00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:29.560
felt so great?

00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:33.320
Why am I still

00:50:33.517 --> 00:50:35.717
subconsciously rejecting her?

00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:40.600
Maybe...

00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:47.040
I'm just afraid.

00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:49.960
I'm afraid that I'll be in love...

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:54.100
I'm afraid that

00:50:54.488 --> 00:50:55.888
I'll mess up

00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:00.880
and lose her
like what happened in the past.

00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:06.520
Hey, Khemjira...

00:51:09.184 --> 00:51:10.664
Do you know that

00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:16.720
every time you say you love me,

00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:22.160
it makes me want to believe it

00:51:24.248 --> 00:51:25.888
and love you right back?

00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:33.560
However, I'm too afraid to do so.

00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:37.400
I...

00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:39.520
I don't know

00:51:39.545 --> 00:51:41.025
if you're just falling for me,

00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:42.880
hooked on me,

00:51:42.905 --> 00:51:45.905
or trying to fulfilling
the simple promise we've made.

00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:52.440
You crazy girl...

00:51:52.792 --> 00:51:55.472
make my heart softer day by day.

00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:04.600
I don't want our words
to become meaningless.

00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:09.480
I don't want to...

00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:11.640
I really don't want to lose you.

00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:14.720
As of now,

00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:17.800
I'm still too afraid

00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:20.240
to say that

00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:24.840
I also love you.

00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:30.640
Please give me time, okay?

00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:34.400
Please give me a bit more time

00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:37.360
until I'm no longer afraid

00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:39.920
to love you

00:52:39.945 --> 00:52:41.120
the way you deserve

00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:44.400
to be loved.

00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:51.320
Please don't walk away from me
before I'm ready, Khemjira.

00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:21.166
Was it you who made the mess yesterday?

00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:22.440
I'm sorry, Boss.

00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:24.600
I have no idea that Khem is...

00:53:24.625 --> 00:53:26.105
Khem is my husband.

00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:27.240
- Huh?
- Huh?!

00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:29.480
Hi.

00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:31.880
How am I going to continue working here?

00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:34.240
I miss you so much, Rin!

00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:35.680
Is there a problem, Prapai?

00:53:36.024 --> 00:53:37.224
If you go,

00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:39.040
you won't be able to move on

00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:40.240
and will keep getting hurt.

00:53:40.571 --> 00:53:42.600
She will never come back and love you.
