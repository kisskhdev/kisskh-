WEBVTT

00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.716
Tonight at 9 pm.

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:03.410
At the viewing room on the third floor.

00:00:03.447 --> 00:00:06.167
If any of you think it’s unfair,

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.541
and you want me to give anything back, I’ll do so.

00:00:09.563 --> 00:00:11.978
Your sister disappeared?

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:14.698
When we came back,

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:16.494
Chatfah was gone.

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:17.450
I’M WAITING FOR YOU

00:00:17.483 --> 00:00:21.127
Who do you think is the suspect?

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.480
Bua.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:24.730
Picha.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:26.727
Chompoo.

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:31.680
(Everyone might have been fooled all along.)

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.636
8…9…10.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:46.785
Got you, Chom!

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.341
Come on!

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.552
I’m the first one found again?

00:00:50.581 --> 00:00:53.178
Well, you keep hiding in the same places.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.618
Got you, Bua!

00:01:04.654 --> 00:01:06.872
Oh no! I almost got you.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.669
I’m the best seeker among us.

00:01:10.698 --> 00:01:13.185
But Chat is the toughest one to find.

00:01:13.236 --> 00:01:15.010
She likes to hide in strange places.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.323
We could never find her.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.043
Why don’t we pretend to stop seeking?

00:01:20.072 --> 00:01:21.767
She will come out eventually.

00:01:21.818 --> 00:01:23.578
What if she doesn’t come out?

00:01:23.607 --> 00:01:24.725
Who would have to take responsibility?

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:26.087
I would be in trouble again.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.280
What can you do about it?

00:01:27.316 --> 00:01:28.727
You’re born a sister after all.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:29.687
So damn unfortunate.

00:01:29.716 --> 00:01:31.454
Why are you swearing, Chom?

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:32.490
Don’t let mom catch that.

00:01:35.178 --> 00:01:37.061
Where are you, Chatfah?

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.596
Come out! I’m freakin’ hungry.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.229
(Actually, life is just a game.)

00:01:57.272 --> 00:01:58.814
It’s been raining pretty hard,

00:01:58.843 --> 00:02:00.210
she couldn’t have gone very far.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.007
If she was by herself,

00:02:02.043 --> 00:02:03.363
then she can’t have gone too far.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.374
What I’m afraid is

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:06.705
someone took her.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.320
The damned rain even washed all the footprints.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.200
Do you think her sisters are weird?

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.309
Their testimonies were odd too.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.470
We’ll have to see during the investigation.

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.320
Captain, please come this way.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.219
There are blood stains and a footprint.

00:02:35.243 --> 00:02:36.552
She must have come this way.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.385
Only one footprint?

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:40.145
Then she must have been here alone.

00:02:40.174 --> 00:02:41.250
No one else was with her.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.109
I have only found one footprint for now.

00:02:44.887 --> 00:02:45.887
(A game, )

00:02:46.196 --> 00:02:47.963
(that even though you don’t want to play, )

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.909
What made her run away that way?

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.876
(you can’t afford to lose.)

00:02:55.003 --> 00:02:57.112
(Since your life's on the line for it.)

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.203
Please say something.

00:02:58.225 --> 00:02:59.061
Please make way.

00:02:59.083 --> 00:03:00.385
Please calm down.

00:03:00.421 --> 00:03:01.694
Please make way!

00:03:02.858 --> 00:03:03.858
Easy there.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:05.534
Miss Picha!

00:03:05.556 --> 00:03:06.681
Officers, please let us ask one question.

00:03:06.705 --> 00:03:07.927
Miss Bua, is it true that

00:03:07.956 --> 00:03:09.941
Miss Chatfah Bupphachinda is gone

00:03:09.963 --> 00:03:11.600
and the police still can’t find her.

00:03:15.178 --> 00:03:16.232
That’s true.

00:03:16.254 --> 00:03:17.149
Oh!

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.281
See? She actually went missing.

00:03:18.305 --> 00:03:21.658
But we can’t answer anything for now

00:03:21.694 --> 00:03:23.660
since we’re worried about Chat’s safety.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.396
Let’s leave it to the police for now.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.280
Is it true that Miss Chatfah is gone

00:03:29.323 --> 00:03:30.341
after the will has been revealed?

00:03:30.363 --> 00:03:31.452
Is it true that Miss Chatfah’s been given

00:03:31.476 --> 00:03:33.450
everything of Mr. Asok's legacy.

00:03:33.476 --> 00:03:35.149
Do you think this is a murder case?

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.476
Hey!

00:03:35.512 --> 00:03:35.905
Is it true?

00:03:35.934 --> 00:03:36.516
What’s the deal here?

00:03:36.552 --> 00:03:37.632
Please answer the question.

00:03:37.665 --> 00:03:39.512
Hey, if you don’t have any ethics,

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:40.996
then have some manners.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.640
My sister has just gone missing.

00:03:42.676 --> 00:03:43.906
How can you spit out such words?

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:44.901
Listen to the questions you’ve asked.

00:03:44.923 --> 00:03:46.128
If I were you, I wouldn’t dare ask.

00:03:46.152 --> 00:03:47.510
It’s not hard to find a manners guidebook,

00:03:47.534 --> 00:03:49.650
why don't you get one and have a read?

00:03:49.687 --> 00:03:50.687
Urgh!

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.309
We’re just doing our jobs.

00:03:53.352 --> 00:03:54.290
So that means it’s true?

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.136
So what’s going to happen to the Buppha Company?

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.840
Is Miss Bua going to step up as the CEO?

00:03:57.876 --> 00:04:00.472
Wait, did you listen to what I said?

00:04:00.494 --> 00:04:01.494
Move!

00:04:01.578 --> 00:04:02.596
Chom…

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:10.350
Right now…

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.379
Right now, me and my family are not ready

00:04:13.403 --> 00:04:15.149
to answer any questions.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.607
Because the only thing

00:04:18.007 --> 00:04:19.949
that I and my family are concerned about

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.130
is Chat’s safety.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.061
What I hope for the most is

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.040
to have all family members together again.

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.654
Which is more important than the company

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.730
or even my title.

00:04:54.538 --> 00:04:56.540
I could tell you were putting on a show.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.101
If I don’t get to be the CEO,

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:01.614
I’ll turn to politics.

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:04.000
You’re just going to

00:05:04.036 --> 00:05:05.436
start building up your support now?

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.597
You’re turning the disappearance of your sister

00:05:07.621 --> 00:05:08.909
into a show?

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.200
It’s turning a crisis into an opportunity.

00:05:11.258 --> 00:05:12.494
That's what Dad taught us.

00:05:12.538 --> 00:05:16.130
Wow, you’re the real daddy’s girl.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.854
I’m so confused,

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:19.614
why didn't Dad give you the company?

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.334
You're exactly who Dad wanted you to be.

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:24.276
You didn’t get it either.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:25.852
And the reason why you didn't get it

00:05:25.876 --> 00:05:28.036
was because you’re so confrontational.

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.136
If you don’t have any consciousness

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.643
then have some IQ.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.061
Who would be a genius at pretending like you?

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:36.880
A sister went missing

00:05:36.923 --> 00:05:38.807
yet you have the gut to worry about your image.

00:05:38.843 --> 00:05:39.843
Sorry?

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.432
Didn’t she go missing because of you?

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.530
You’re the one watching her last.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.701
Where did you go then?

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.018
You were the first one who fled.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.134
I went out to take a call.

00:05:53.163 --> 00:05:54.181
Are you sure?

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.085
Did you go and hide something?

00:05:56.109 --> 00:05:57.505
Just say what you meant to say.

00:05:57.534 --> 00:05:58.167
What did you hide?

00:05:58.196 --> 00:05:58.749
Hide what?

00:05:58.785 --> 00:06:00.130
Why would you keep secrets with me?

00:06:00.152 --> 00:06:00.676
That’s you!

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:01.721
- What would I have hidden? - Why would you keep secrets with me?

00:06:01.745 --> 00:06:03.083
Please stop that.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.709
Aren’t you guys stressed out enough already?

00:06:11.221 --> 00:06:13.220
I’m most worried about Chat right now.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:15.309
Please don’t fight,

00:06:15.345 --> 00:06:16.345
I’m begging you.

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:18.778
(This might be the only thing)

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.210
(that Chatfah didn’t lie about.)

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:27.578
What the hell was that?

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.396
The police are having a search.

00:06:49.432 --> 00:06:51.774
Please wait in the room we’ve arranged for you.

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.850
The maid has got your clothes prepared.

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:57.898
Excuse me, we didn’t give permission.

00:06:57.927 --> 00:07:00.341
Especially for our private rooms.

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:01.607
The circumstance shows that

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.590
this place is a crime scene

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:05.963
so the police have the right to search.

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:12.610
(Our family is so good)

00:07:12.647 --> 00:07:14.392
(at pretending and playing games.)

00:08:38.436 --> 00:08:39.578
Stabbed

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:41.178
and fell down from here.

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:47.970
All 3 sisters have testified.

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:50.632
They all said they didn’t see

00:08:50.654 --> 00:08:52.414
when she was stabbed or disappeared.

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:55.927
Who else was there in this mansion?

00:08:57.930 --> 00:08:59.985
Apart from the 3 sisters, there are

00:09:00.029 --> 00:09:02.363
the maid, uncle called Kajorn,

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.360
and Uncle Kajorn’s daughter.

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:07.490
Kajorn said he went to the orchid garden

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:08.930
during the time of the crime.

00:09:09.607 --> 00:09:11.610
He said the system had a malfunction.

00:09:12.305 --> 00:09:13.309
As for the maid,

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:14.792
she said she took sleeping pills.

00:09:14.829 --> 00:09:16.581
We’re trying to verify that.

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:21.447
Lastly, Kajorn’s daughter is…

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:36.865
Any news? What did the police say?

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.570
You can’t get anything from them.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.483
We went because

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.178
they wanted the answers from us.

00:09:47.316 --> 00:09:49.180
They also asked me lots of questions.

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:51.861
But I was only in my room,

00:09:52.545 --> 00:09:54.550
I have no idea what happened.

00:10:02.887 --> 00:10:04.989
Would you like to have some rest, Parn?

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:06.618
I’ll take you inside.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.141
I’m worried about Chat.

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:15.570
How would she be doing now?

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.327
When she went missing,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.112
it was raining and so dark.

00:10:21.141 --> 00:10:23.978
I don’t know if anyone would ever find her.

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:29.032
The police are spreading out to search.

00:10:29.527 --> 00:10:31.530
I hope you will look out for the news.

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:36.756
Did you really not see the suspect’s face?

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:57.207
I can’t be of any help at all!

00:10:58.390 --> 00:10:59.963
All these times,

00:11:00.712 --> 00:11:02.710
Chat has been so nice to me.

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:06.349
But when she needs help,

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.930
I couldn’t do anything for her.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.250
I couldn’t be of any help!

00:11:11.774 --> 00:11:13.069
Parn, Parn.

00:11:13.105 --> 00:11:15.020
I couldn't be of any help!

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:16.429
Trust in the police.

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:19.352
They will find Chat soon.

00:11:35.469 --> 00:11:37.381
Is the bitch Chat that Parn was talking about

00:11:37.418 --> 00:11:38.910
the same as the one we know?

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:10.080
Pi, I can’t trust anyone.

00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:13.483
Someone must have done that to Chat.

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:16.763
Why are they so hateful to Chat?

00:12:19.527 --> 00:12:21.047
Chat has been good to me

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:23.265
and to everyone all along.

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:27.629
This leg…

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:29.985
If it weren’t for Chat,

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:33.192
I would have been dead.

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:37.510
Parn…

00:12:38.821 --> 00:12:40.820
I can’t say anything for now.

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:44.356
But if I know anything,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.778
I will let you know right away.

00:13:24.916 --> 00:13:25.916
Miss.

00:13:27.774 --> 00:13:29.770
Sorry for surprising you.

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:41.621
I think you’d better wait

00:13:41.643 --> 00:13:43.620
in the area we’ve sectioned out for you.

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:46.530
I’ve already told your two sisters

00:13:46.552 --> 00:13:47.665
to go and wait there.

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:51.090
I’m just drinking some water in my house.

00:13:51.127 --> 00:13:52.552
That should be okay, right?

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:58.240
I think you had better go and wait.

00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:07.607
Let me ask you something.

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:09.505
When you ran through the woods

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:10.763
to try and find your sister,

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:13.636
didn’t you notice anything strange there?

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:17.301
I believe I’ve already told

00:14:17.323 --> 00:14:19.170
the investigators everything.

00:14:21.236 --> 00:14:22.341
Probably so.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:24.770
But sometimes.

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:29.214
People forget little details.

00:14:29.614 --> 00:14:31.294
Otherwise, they left it out intentionally.

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:34.414
My sister is missing.

00:14:34.901 --> 00:14:36.458
Why would I hide anything?

00:14:37.556 --> 00:14:38.556
I don’t know.

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:40.989
You should tell me.

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:43.701
I think the questions you asked me

00:14:43.723 --> 00:14:45.549
were very rude.

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:47.949
Especially to the family of the deceased.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:51.905
We haven’t found the dead body.

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:54.472
How did you know she’s dead?

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:02.167
Sorry, I used the wrong word.

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:06.756
I haven’t been in my right mind these days.

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:08.970
It’s alright.

00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:11.214
It’s normal that,

00:15:11.243 --> 00:15:13.210
after a traumatic experience,

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:15.490
people would say

00:15:15.534 --> 00:15:17.214
or do weird things like this.

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:30.250
What’s going on?

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:34.487
This is the middle one?

00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:38.087
Yes, the one closest to the missing sister.

00:16:01.934 --> 00:16:03.076
Dad, you knew it, right?

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:07.621
If you do this,

00:16:11.672 --> 00:16:13.745
our family would never be the same.

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.960
Why would they put up so many barricades?

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:45.323
I don’t feel so well.

00:16:45.345 --> 00:16:46.763
I’m worried about my sister too.

00:16:47.854 --> 00:16:49.850
They’re probably looking for evidence.

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:51.120
They’d probably take it

00:16:51.156 --> 00:16:52.156
if they have found one.

00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:53.389
Damn it.

00:16:53.425 --> 00:16:54.501
I’m hungry.

00:16:54.916 --> 00:16:56.637
Didn’t you say you’re worried about your sister?

00:16:56.661 --> 00:16:58.770
How could you be in the mood for that?

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:00.660
Why?

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:02.945
I can’t freaking eat?

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:05.221
I’m not a prisoner just yet.

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:12.749
Well, if you had watched over her,

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.389
we wouldn’t end up in this situation.

00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:21.672
Would you stop blaming me?

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:28.749
Where did you go?

00:17:31.861 --> 00:17:35.127
You haven’t told us where you went.

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:52.305
How did Chat end up like that?

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:54.887
I don’t know either.

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:57.600
But you should hurry and leave for now.

00:17:57.950 --> 00:17:58.950
I’m not leaving.

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:02.370
I’m not leaving you here alone, Chom.

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:04.625
Please leave.

00:18:04.669 --> 00:18:06.458
Things will get messier with you here.

00:18:06.487 --> 00:18:07.487
No!

00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:08.952
That happened to Chat

00:18:08.989 --> 00:18:10.763
and you still want me to run away alone?

00:18:14.043 --> 00:18:15.563
Then what do you want me to say?

00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:18.407
That I was fucking you?

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:21.730
That I was fucking my sister’s fiance

00:18:21.767 --> 00:18:23.520
when she was in that state?

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:27.010
I know what would be on the news.

00:18:27.047 --> 00:18:28.683
I know what people are going to say about me.

00:18:28.705 --> 00:18:30.174
I know what they would think of me.

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:33.920
Both of us won’t be able to face the world.

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:37.876
People would even think we cooperated on this.

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:42.952
Just trust me and go for now.

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:49.898
I never care

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:52.094
about what people think of me.

00:18:53.876 --> 00:18:55.432
But the only one I care about

00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:57.930
is you, Chom.

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:03.643
If you care about me

00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:07.090
Then just trust me and leave

00:19:07.112 --> 00:19:08.112
before anyone sees you.

00:19:45.563 --> 00:19:47.003
I’ve called the police.

00:19:47.032 --> 00:19:48.480
How is Chat doing?

00:20:00.276 --> 00:20:01.898
Where did Chat go?

00:20:03.767 --> 00:20:05.120
I told you,

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:06.669
I saw a shadow of someone

00:20:06.698 --> 00:20:07.450
walking into the kitchen

00:20:07.483 --> 00:20:08.820
so I went after it to check,

00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:12.334
What if that was the suspect?

00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:14.130
Stop pretending.

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:16.807
You were shaking in fear.

00:20:16.843 --> 00:20:18.414
You can’t have the head to do anything.

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:22.232
I had it together more than you think.

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:23.992
You are my sister,

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:26.378
don’t you think I can’t tell when you lie.

00:20:26.683 --> 00:20:28.680
If you’re not going to believe me

00:20:28.974 --> 00:20:30.509
then why did you bother asking?

00:20:30.552 --> 00:20:31.905
But I do believe you.

00:20:34.632 --> 00:20:36.630
I found a man’s footprint

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:38.930
running out of the back of the kitchen.

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:41.963
What do you mean?

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:49.003
It means that last night,

00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:51.454
there weren’t just the 3 of us.

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:10.189
What happened?

00:21:10.247 --> 00:21:13.607
I’m a childhood friend of the girls from that family.

00:21:14.603 --> 00:21:16.138
If you guys are really friends,

00:21:16.189 --> 00:21:18.140
you must have known what happened.

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:21.059
We were friends when we were so young.

00:21:21.083 --> 00:21:22.363
We haven’t talked for so long.

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:23.534
Last night, a suspect got in

00:21:23.556 --> 00:21:24.480
and stabbed the owner of the mansion.

00:21:24.516 --> 00:21:25.694
A suspect went in?

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:27.803
That’s all we know for now.

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:29.985
Do you happen to know

00:21:30.014 --> 00:21:32.363
where the woods end?

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:35.156
The woods is connected to

00:21:35.185 --> 00:21:36.967
the Bupphachinda orchid garden.

00:21:36.996 --> 00:21:38.363
It belongs to the Buppha Company.

00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:40.160
Shall I guide you the way?

00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:41.963
Thank you.

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:43.890
We’re not so familiar with the route here.

00:21:44.247 --> 00:21:45.247
My pleasure.

00:22:08.509 --> 00:22:09.578
I told you

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:11.978
that I wasn’t the one who stabbed Chat

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:15.200
and I’ve never planned to do anything to her.

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:17.614
I might hate her

00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:19.156
but she’s still my sister.

00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:20.720
Chom!

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:24.247
No one’s saying that you did.

00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:27.570
I just feel like

00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:30.210
you’re hiding something.

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:32.350
There.

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:34.567
Don’t they mean the same thing?

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:38.174
What about you?

00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:41.440
Where did you go for so long?

00:22:59.010 --> 00:22:59.563
My…

00:22:59.585 --> 00:23:00.585
My sister…

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:02.683
My sister was stabbed.

00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:05.403
Nothing much.

00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:07.149
I just

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:08.160
lost my mind

00:23:08.196 --> 00:23:09.836
and couldn’t communicate with the police.

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:11.432
You?

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.200
Lost your mind and you couldn’t communicate?

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:15.170
Well, it’s not like my sister got stabbed

00:23:15.192 --> 00:23:16.780
and fell down on a daily basis.

00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:20.380
What about you?

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:22.640
You left me and where did you go?

00:23:25.061 --> 00:23:27.060
I told you.

00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:29.781
I went to find a towel to stop the bleeding.

00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:33.810
PI, I’M WAITING FOR YOU.

00:23:57.570 --> 00:23:59.290
(IPHONE IS DISABLED, TRY AGAIN IN 1 MINUTE.)

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:15.720
Well I…

00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:18.123
Took too long to find the towel

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:19.990
and Chatfah was already gone.

00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:32.570
Okay.

00:24:34.392 --> 00:24:36.390
Then I’ll trust you guys

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:38.589
if you guys trust me.

00:24:40.218 --> 00:24:41.218
What do you mean?

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.927
I was born your sister,

00:24:43.963 --> 00:24:45.930
I know it when you’re lying.

00:24:48.458 --> 00:24:49.905
But like I said,

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:52.370
I will trust you guys,

00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:54.349
if you guys would trust me.

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:02.370
Isn’t that how our family was taught?

00:25:03.781 --> 00:25:05.200
Since we’re family,

00:25:05.850 --> 00:25:07.156
we must trust each other

00:25:08.429 --> 00:25:09.861
and we must protect each other.

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:13.985
The older has to take care of the younger

00:25:15.367 --> 00:25:17.370
and the younger has to listen to the elder

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:20.739
because nothing is more important

00:25:20.763 --> 00:25:21.820
than our family.

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:26.741
Even if you have questions,

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:29.498
don’t ask.

00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:32.341
Because it’s the only way

00:25:33.447 --> 00:25:35.450
to keep our family alive.

00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:40.120
So what do you say?

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:42.880
Deal?

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:49.600
Then from now on,

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:52.101
we have to say the same thing.

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:55.425
Our sister is gone

00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:57.898
and the 3 of us

00:25:58.360 --> 00:25:59.956
are not involved at all.

00:26:12.072 --> 00:26:13.374
As I mentioned,

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:15.563
I’m worried about the river in the woods.

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:17.248
Especially during monsoon season,

00:26:17.272 --> 00:26:18.960
there can be flash floods.

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:21.280
No matter how good a swimmer you are,

00:26:21.316 --> 00:26:22.945
you can’t resist the flow of the water.

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:25.869
Thank you so much.

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:27.320
My pleasure.

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:37.570
Hello.

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:38.152
Hello.

00:26:38.189 --> 00:26:39.861
You can’t enter at the moment.

00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:44.167
He’s the fiance of my sister.

00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:53.869
Why are you here?

00:26:53.905 --> 00:26:55.549
I told you not to come for now.

00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:57.367
How can I just stay home

00:26:57.410 --> 00:26:58.770
and listen to the news?

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.200
I don’t want you to go through this alone.

00:27:10.952 --> 00:27:11.952
Thana.

00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:16.007
Um, I was showing the police the way

00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:18.392
it might help with the search.

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:21.163
Chatfah is missing

00:27:21.192 --> 00:27:22.465
so I got kind of worried too.

00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:25.185
I want to help with whatever I can.

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:27.250
Okay, thanks.

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:36.865
Chom.

00:27:36.894 --> 00:27:37.440
Yeah?

00:27:37.483 --> 00:27:39.440
Let’s go. Get in the car.

00:27:40.392 --> 00:27:40.887
Okay.

00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:43.745
You must be Nathat,

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:46.000
Chatfah’s fiance, right?

00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:50.392
Your girlfriend has gone missing,

00:27:50.429 --> 00:27:51.890
so you must be so worried.

00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:54.590
Yes.

00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:56.712
Thank you for helping me find Chat.

00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:58.640
My pleasure.

00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:01.032
Uh, this is Thana.

00:28:01.061 --> 00:28:02.290
He’s Chat’s friend.

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:03.163
They used to play together often

00:28:03.185 --> 00:28:04.185
when we were young.

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:07.380
Thana.

00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:09.054
I’ll get going.

00:28:09.192 --> 00:28:10.192
See you around.

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:11.680
Alright.

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:34.220
What?

00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:37.098
Chatfah agreed to be the brand ambassador

00:28:37.127 --> 00:28:38.520
for my competitor brand?

00:28:38.545 --> 00:28:39.790
That’s right, Ms Pi!

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:40.640
When they found out through the news

00:28:40.683 --> 00:28:42.312
that Miss Chat is missing,

00:28:42.349 --> 00:28:44.640
they went chaotic.

00:28:44.676 --> 00:28:46.305
I heard a rumor that

00:28:46.349 --> 00:28:48.538
they might postpone the launching.

00:28:52.196 --> 00:28:52.792
BLOODY LEGACY!

00:28:52.829 --> 00:28:56.149
(GREAT SHOCK! INVESTORS POINT OUT THAT CHATFAH’S SCANDAL MIGHT AFFECT BUPPHA’S STOCK.)

00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:05.367
How are you doing, Bua?

00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:08.749
As you can see.

00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:11.578
How is it going out there?

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:15.483
Forget about the things outside for now,

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:17.992
let’s focus on us.

00:29:19.025 --> 00:29:22.029
I want you to avoid the press for now.

00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:24.567
Don’t answer any questions from anyone

00:29:24.603 --> 00:29:25.985
and tell your parents so too.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.163
No problem.

00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:30.986
I’ve already talked to my parents

00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:32.152
and my grandmother.

00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:35.941
You don’t have to worry.

00:29:37.025 --> 00:29:39.030
For now, Chat’s safety comes first.

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:50.676
Chompoo, you too.

00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:52.829
You should keep some distance

00:29:52.858 --> 00:29:53.985
with Nathat for now.

00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:56.637
Especially when there's a scandal about Chat,

00:29:56.661 --> 00:29:57.963
people might make a fuss

00:29:57.985 --> 00:29:59.098
about you and Nathat.

00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:00.850
Come on.

00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:03.425
Who would think I would kill my sister

00:30:03.461 --> 00:30:04.461
for a guy?

00:30:04.690 --> 00:30:06.181
But is that possible?

00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:13.585
(From the news, )

00:30:13.621 --> 00:30:16.152
(the public should be able to judge)

00:30:16.181 --> 00:30:17.941
(the true color of people.)

00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:20.800
(Chat is a good girl.)

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:22.065
(That’s why my grandson)

00:30:22.101 --> 00:30:23.980
(had decided to marry her.)

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.149
(A good person will be blessed.)

00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:31.694
(While people with evil intentions, )

00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:32.756
(thirst)

00:30:33.290 --> 00:30:34.407
(and greed, )

00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:38.749
(will have to pay for their sins one day.)

00:30:42.712 --> 00:30:44.138
Hey, was she targeting you?

00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:46.800
That hag was spitting all that,

00:30:46.836 --> 00:30:48.290
who else could it be?

00:30:58.970 --> 00:31:01.170
We’ve been searching for 12 hours now.

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:03.214
Still, there’s no clue at all.

00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:04.472
A petite girl

00:31:04.509 --> 00:31:05.687
and even injured.

00:31:05.716 --> 00:31:07.170
How did she manage to go so far?

00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:09.570
The injured part is one thing,

00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:12.501
but why would she run here as an escape?

00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:17.949
Is this the river he mentioned?

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:20.080
What was his name?

00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:22.190
Thana.

00:31:22.654 --> 00:31:24.650
He said he was Chatfah’s childhood friend.

00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:28.356
By the way, you’re from here too, right?

00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:30.610
About Chatfah’s household? Do you know anything

00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:32.741
I’m not quite from here.

00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:33.643
I just used to live here

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:34.840
while my dad was still alive.

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:37.163
Only rich people live here.

00:31:37.510 --> 00:31:38.632
If it wasn’t because my dad worked here,

00:31:38.654 --> 00:31:39.814
I would never have been here.

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:51.563
Captain!

00:31:52.270 --> 00:31:53.781
The 3 sisters are about to

00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:55.330
head back to Bangkok.

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:02.356
Wait a minute.

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:06.509
You shouldn’t be going anywhere yet.

00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:11.236
I think I have done everything to cooperate.

00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:12.866
Is there an order from the court

00:32:12.890 --> 00:32:16.785
or any law that can confine me?

00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:20.618
Your family is quite odd.

00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:22.756
Your sister went missing

00:32:22.836 --> 00:32:24.186
but everyone is able to focus on their jobs

00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:25.607
like nothing happened.

00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:30.276
You’re rude to me yet again.

00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:32.378
Your family might think otherwise

00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:35.003
but in my family,

00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:38.792
this is how we were taught.

00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:45.130
Also,

00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:47.156
no matter in what ‘role’

00:32:47.541 --> 00:32:48.872
you’ve returned to this place.

00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:51.076
I still stand that,

00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:53.185
our families are not the same.

00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:59.127
Dad!

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:02.400
Hang in there, dad!

00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:05.370
Dad!

00:33:07.170 --> 00:33:08.170
Dad!

00:33:22.150 --> 00:33:24.690
Regardless of whether it is really a coincident

00:33:24.727 --> 00:33:26.690
that you’re responsible for this case or not,

00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:30.480
if you have a bias from the past,

00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:34.320
I will report it to your commander

00:33:34.356 --> 00:33:36.509
to remove you from this case immediately.

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:44.145
I hope you’ll work hard,

00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:45.614
Captain.

00:34:04.050 --> 00:34:05.050
Hello.

00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:07.025
Why did you bring Chom with you?

00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:08.916
I asked to come along.

00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:12.632
I wanted to explain this to grandma myself.

00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:13.970
Where is Grandma?

00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:16.145
I will talk to her myself.

00:34:16.174 --> 00:34:18.952
How dare you set foot in my house?

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:20.840
Nathat.

00:34:21.832 --> 00:34:23.830
You can never think for yourself.

00:34:24.487 --> 00:34:26.490
Don’t you know that when you do this,

00:34:26.523 --> 00:34:28.320
things would get more troublesome?

00:34:33.003 --> 00:34:34.320
I’m sorry, grandma.

00:34:36.174 --> 00:34:38.170
If you are really sorry,

00:34:38.676 --> 00:34:40.680
then you would never have done all this.

00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:51.301
Who sent these pictures to you?

00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:53.367
Doesn’t matter who sent them.

00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:55.360
What matter is

00:34:55.403 --> 00:34:57.360
who have seen these pictures.

00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:00.647
If someone can send me these pictures,

00:35:00.916 --> 00:35:03.294
then they could send it to the press too.

00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:07.512
So what would you say to the press now?!

00:35:07.549 --> 00:35:08.814
Mother!

00:35:08.843 --> 00:35:11.294
There was nothing between us that night.

00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:12.390
I got drunk and I went home.

00:35:12.414 --> 00:35:13.648
Nathat got drunk and he went home.

00:35:13.672 --> 00:35:15.476
The truth is not like what you think.

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:16.989
Who cares about the truth?!

00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:19.229
People only care about

00:35:19.265 --> 00:35:21.047
whether it can become a scandal

00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:26.487
or whether it can make Nathat a suspect.

00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:54.700
Hello?

00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:55.950
Picha.

00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:57.418
Can you stop the car?

00:35:57.770 --> 00:35:59.069
What are you talking about?

00:35:59.112 --> 00:36:00.603
I’m not stopping the car.

00:36:00.632 --> 00:36:02.887
You can’t stop me from going anywhere.

00:36:02.916 --> 00:36:04.232
I’m not stopping you.

00:36:04.269 --> 00:36:05.989
I’m asking if you’re able to stop your car.

00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:08.370
The brake fluid of your car was leaking.

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:09.400
What?

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:16.140
Hey!

00:36:17.290 --> 00:36:18.290
Hey!

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:19.818
I can’t brake.

00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:21.090
Okay.

00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:22.189
Calm down.

00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:23.767
Do as I say.

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:26.363
Don’t hit the accelerator anymore.

00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:28.341
Turn on the hazard lights

00:36:28.378 --> 00:36:29.738
and slowly let the car decelerate.

00:36:30.170 --> 00:36:31.040
Honk to alarm the car in front of you

00:36:31.069 --> 00:36:32.069
every now and then.

00:36:32.109 --> 00:36:33.556
There’s no car in front of me.

00:36:34.290 --> 00:36:35.956
What should I do next?

00:36:36.174 --> 00:36:38.603
Slowly pull the car over on the left.

00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:42.501
You can do it, right?

00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:44.269
Okay, I probably can.

00:36:44.305 --> 00:36:45.025
Okay.

00:36:45.069 --> 00:36:46.305
I’ll try.

00:37:14.938 --> 00:37:16.990
YOU’RE NEXT.

00:37:25.992 --> 00:37:26.992
I’m sorry

00:37:27.850 --> 00:37:29.701
to make you witness such a scene.

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:33.280
It’s alright.

00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:35.520
I’m more worried about you.

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:37.534
I’m fine.

00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:39.570
After you go home,

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:41.927
Grandma didn't bother me anymore.

00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:44.305
Good.

00:37:45.389 --> 00:37:47.390
I’m still worried about you.

00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:53.200
Chom.

00:37:54.545 --> 00:37:55.803
My engagement ring!

00:38:33.498 --> 00:38:34.909
Captain, here’s your coffee.

00:38:36.109 --> 00:38:37.109
Thanks.

00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:39.665
The press is lurking around these days.

00:38:39.701 --> 00:38:41.141
Do not let them in.

00:38:41.178 --> 00:38:42.178
Yes, sir.

00:39:02.181 --> 00:39:03.585
Hey, wait!

00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:07.163
How did you find me?

00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:10.160
I saw your car

00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:11.680
so I went to check

00:39:11.723 --> 00:39:13.127
but didn’t find anyone.

00:39:13.590 --> 00:39:15.207
So I kept looking for you

00:39:15.490 --> 00:39:18.567
and found you looking suspicious.

00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:22.167
So why did you pull me into the woods?

00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:24.421
Because I don’t want to see you

00:39:24.465 --> 00:39:26.385
getting arrested for trespassing your own house.

00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:28.261
Are you trying to sneak

00:39:28.298 --> 00:39:29.469
into your own house?

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:31.389
It’s not even my house.

00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:33.614
Aren’t you curious

00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:34.756
why I’m trying to get in?

00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:37.898
You’re all dressed up like this

00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:40.152
I assume you’d never tell even if I asked.

00:39:42.050 --> 00:39:43.170
You seem so well-versed.

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:51.069
But if you really want to get into the mansion,

00:39:51.770 --> 00:39:52.770
I know a way.

00:39:56.970 --> 00:39:58.356
Where are you taking me?

00:39:59.650 --> 00:40:02.094
Well, the way into your house.

00:40:02.123 --> 00:40:03.123
What?

00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:04.380
Here?

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:07.767
Yes, Chatfah told me herself.

00:40:07.810 --> 00:40:08.821
When we were young,

00:40:08.843 --> 00:40:10.734
Chatfah were so good at hide-and-seek

00:40:10.778 --> 00:40:12.730
that even you guys couldn’t find her.

00:40:13.350 --> 00:40:17.003
So I cheated by not closing my eyes

00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:18.378
and just followed Chatfah.

00:40:24.501 --> 00:40:25.501
My!

00:40:25.770 --> 00:40:27.287
Hey! Why didn’t you tell me

00:40:27.323 --> 00:40:28.650
if you’re going to stop.

00:40:29.590 --> 00:40:30.590
We’ve arrived.

00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:37.607
This is where Chatfah was hiding

00:40:37.636 --> 00:40:39.110
and you guys couldn’t find her.

00:40:39.141 --> 00:40:41.640
It’s also a path into your house.

00:40:45.730 --> 00:40:46.756
After you.

00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:07.083
Hello, where did you put the ring?

00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:09.498
Don’t tell me you went there.

00:41:09.534 --> 00:41:10.581
Hurry up and tell me

00:41:10.618 --> 00:41:11.941
where you put the ring.

00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:14.269
On the table on the left.

00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:28.778
I can’t find it.

00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:30.900
Or…

00:41:31.410 --> 00:41:32.821
Did the police take it already?

00:41:32.843 --> 00:41:34.203
If I weren’t mistaken,

00:41:35.210 --> 00:41:36.465
at that time…

00:41:39.010 --> 00:41:40.283
(If it is a game)

00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:43.570
(it’s probably a game you can never win.)

00:41:44.250 --> 00:41:45.898
Hey, I’ll hang up for now.

00:41:49.530 --> 00:41:50.850
(Because in this game, )

00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:53.476
(the enemy might be someone you love)

00:41:53.770 --> 00:41:56.181
(who set a trap using trust.)

00:42:14.010 --> 00:42:16.356
(The only way to win this game)

00:42:17.450 --> 00:42:19.010
(is to love no one)

00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:20.545
(other than yourself.)

00:42:29.010 --> 00:42:31.000
I will keep it a secret between us.

00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:32.040
What do you want?

00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:33.469
I want to know

00:42:33.512 --> 00:42:35.898
whether you love yourself

00:42:35.934 --> 00:42:37.541
more than you love Nathat.

00:42:37.563 --> 00:42:38.632
Are you sure that

00:42:38.669 --> 00:42:40.283
when your sister was stabbed,

00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:42.181
she really get stabbed?

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:44.836
Mangkorn…

00:42:44.865 --> 00:42:47.520
If you’re too confident in your intelligence,

00:42:47.850 --> 00:42:49.170
you will become

00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:50.600
a fool.
