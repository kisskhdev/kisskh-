00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.520
Thank you.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.080
It’s no problem.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.680
Um, I’ll return the shirt to you later, okay?

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.360
That flower is so pretty.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.040
The yellow one.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.760
This one?

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.080
How did you get it?

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.480
Forgot again!

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.280
Oh no!

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.160
Dawan!

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.200
Dawan fell into the water!

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.080
Help! Dawan fell into the water!

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.320
Help!

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.240
Someone, please help!

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.080
Dawan!

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.760
Help!

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.040
Dawan!

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.000
What kind of dream was that, Lalin?

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.360
Lalin.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.120
How are you?

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.520
Lalin, about Dawan…

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.120
I can tell.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.520
I think something’s not right.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.960
I know what I’m doing,

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.200
but if you want to talk about it, I’m not going to, Dim.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.040
This is my problem, and I’ll handle it myself.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.720
If you could handle it yourself,

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.200
you probably wouldn’t be sitting here like this.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.040
This is my life.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.640
- I think if you say things like that,
- But you’re hurting others.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.040
Why are you talking to me like this?

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.800
I’m worried about you.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.760
You’re the only one I’ve got.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.040
Then what do you expect me to do when I see you like this?

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.480
Sorry.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.640
I'm sorry for making you worry.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.880
But I’ll handle this problem myself.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.960
Don’t worry, okay? I love you, Dim.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.680
I love you too.

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.320
But if anything’s bothering you, you can always talk to me.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:25.480
Okay

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.840
Are you really okay?

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.640
Yeah, I’m okay.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.960
You're really sure you're okay?

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:32.960
Yes.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.840
Wow,

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.720
look at you—you're all grown up and worrying about your big sister now?

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.960
Let me see...

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.840
You're taller than me already.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.240
Don’t try to change the subject.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.200
Check out these muscles.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.920
Whoa! Looking pretty strong there.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.560
How many kilos of vegetables did you carry?

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:58.960
20 kilos.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.480
Wow, that’s impressive!

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.960
Hey,

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.520
Did you hear what happened this afternoon?

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.680
You mean about Ms.Dawan falling into the water?

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.560
Huh? Ms.Dawan fell into the water?

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.800
Here you go again...

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.400
You never keep up with the news.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.240
Everyone’s been gossiping about it like crazy.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.360
Do you know how it happened?

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.760
How?

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.680
I know.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.640
Someone who was there told me—

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.440
it seemed like she slipped on the bridge.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.360
Her left leg went down first.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.920
I really sympathize with Ms.Dawan.

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.960
She must’ve been terrified and completely shocked.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.960
No, no, the shocking part isn’t that.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:47.920
What?

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.120
Because the person who jumped right in to help—

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.680
It wasn’t Doctor Lan.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.760
But,

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.760
But that person was,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.240
That person was,

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:03.400
Ms. Lalin.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:04.280
Huh?

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.520
Yes.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.000
That's kinda weird.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.400
Whoa, whoa—gossiping about the boss like there’s no tomorrow!

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.280
You’re gonna get in trouble for this, big time.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.520
Come on, don’t play dumb.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.320
It’s stained, Ms.Kanit.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.480
Whoever jumps in to help is good enough, right?

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.160
It’s good that no one got hurt, right?

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.600
That’s true.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.520
Lately our resort seems to have nothing

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.280
but strange things going on.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.680
Just like you can see, especially in our shop.

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.360
Why?

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.920
Well, Madam Mali told me that

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.360
she thinks she saw a thief at our shop.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.480
Huh? A thief?

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:53.600
she told me that she woke up early that morning,

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.240
then went out for a run.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.960
While running, she passed by our shop,

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:02.440
and she saw someone sneaking around behind the shop.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.720
That’s scary.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.360
I don’t think it’s true.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.360
We’ve been here for so long and never encountered anything like that.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:15.200
I think Madam Mali probably woke up early,

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.600
maybe still half-asleep or something,

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.560
and mistook branches and leaves for a person.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.720
That’s possible.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:23.840
Right, Jin?

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.480
Our shop has tons of branches everywhere.

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.920
Yeah, that’s true.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.960
But even if there was someone,

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.280
I’d throw them in jail with a big head.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:36.880
They’re just troublemakers.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.880
Jin, what happened?

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.720
Why do you have red spots all over?

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.360
Huh? Where? Let me see.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.280
Oh, you’re right, they’re all over.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.720
The window screen at home is torn.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.240
The mosquitoes probably got in and bit me.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.840
Oh, a torn screen.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.800
I go to work now so the shop can get cleaned up.

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:05.240
Alright, okay. Bye!

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.200
I think I need to work more to help Lalin.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.800
So she can have some rest.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:28.360
Yeah, that’s true. She hardly have any free time.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:31.240
By the way, how can I help her?

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.320
Come help me at the café.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.360
Got it.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.800
But I want to finish my work in the garden first.

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:39.960
Alright, I’ll go help then.

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.480
Okay, deal.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:44.600
Deal.

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:46.760
Let’s go work in the garden.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.200
You’re coming to help, right?

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.760
Good boy!

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:51.680
Let’s go.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:21.160
Peach,

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.240
why aren’t you picking up?

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:17.240
Mr.Tan, Mr.Ashi

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.360
How’s Dahwan doing?

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.760
She has a slight fever.

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.360
I already gave her some medicine.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.280
She just fell asleep a moment ago.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.120
Ms.Lalin.

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.360
Yes, I just came to visit Dawan.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.120
By the way, how is she?

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.240
Is she getting better?

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.240
She’s okay now.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.200
Luckily, she didn’t inhale any water.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:44.400
But she must have been really shocked and fainted when she fell into the water.

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.680
If it weren’t for you jumping in to help, it would have been much worse.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.640
It’s nothing.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:52.760
But Ms.Lalin ran really fast.

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.240
Even though Dr. Lun wasn’t far away,

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.800
She couldn’t catch up.

00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:00.880
At the resort, I once organized CPR training,

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.720
so I know a bit about it.

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.520
I saw you watching over Dawan the whole time.

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:12.120
Didn’t go anywhere. I brought some food for you.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.480
Thank you.

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.200
Please eat, or you might get sick as well.

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.720
Then the two of us won’t bother you anymore.

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:22.800
And what about you, Ms.Lalin?

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:27.080
I’ll go back with you then.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.960
Here’s fruits for you.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.480
Thank you.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.680
Ms.Lalin.

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.960
I was just passing by,

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:59.080
so I brought some rice porridge for Dawan.

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.880
Would you like to come inside?

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:05.680
Really?

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.760
Of course! Why not?

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.000
Yes.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:13.160
Then I’ll leave Dawan with you for a moment.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.840
I need to go get something from the car.

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:18.520
Yes.

00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.160
Dawan,

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:06.400
how are you? I came to visit you.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:27.560
Get well soon, so we can go out again.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.560
You’re awake?

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.080
Lalin.

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:43.600
It’s me, Lalin.

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:45.960
How are you feeling?

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:48.320
Slowly.

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:07.840
Are you crying?

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:10.080
No,

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:12.760
I’m not crying.

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:18.280
I’m just worried about you.

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.120
I’m okay now.

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:30.960
How about Lun?

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:35.920
She stepped out for a bit but will be back soon.

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.920
I brought some rice porridge for you. Are you hungry?

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:50.000
Eat a little rice porridge, okay?

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:37.200
How are you feeling today?

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.560
But judging from the tone of your crying,

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:46.440
it doesn’t seem like you’re as sad as before.

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:54.200
In my tears today,

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:00.280
there are both good things

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:04.120
and bad things mixed together.

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:09.160
Don’t you think that’s strange?

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:12.120
Really?

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.360
Does that kind of thing actually happen?

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:18.920
Because when someone cries,

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.920
if it’s not from overwhelming joy,

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:25.280
then it must be from deep sorrow.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.640
For me, it’s a strange mix of both.

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:33.400
So… is it good or bad?

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:45.560
It’s good in a way,

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.640
but also not so good in another.

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:03.000
Are you secretly trying to get me to open up?

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:09.480
Would you like to tell me?

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.920
Can I really talk to you about it?

00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:22.840
You can, I’m here to listen.

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.080
That means a lot.

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:38.480
It’s good to let out whatever’s been stuck in my heart.

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:42.920
Don’t you think?

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:47.840
So...

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.160
Whenever you’re ready,

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:55.120
I’m here to listen.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.320
Always.

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:05.480
Have you ever met someone

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:07.960
who’s truly like you?

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:12.320
What do you mean?

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:16.480
The person who is bright.

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:24.880
I used to be someone full of joy.

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:29.320
But…

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:36.520
so many things happened, and that happiness slowly faded away.

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:41.000
To the point

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:44.720
where I couldn’t even remember the last time I laughed.

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:50.040
Until I met that person.

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:55.960
That’s really lovely.

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:08.320
It really is.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.160
Every time you were near her,

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:19.120
when you got to talk to her,

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:23.680
even if it was just for a short moment,

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:28.840
I believe in that moment…

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:32.080
you must have been truly happy.

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:34.680
That sounds enviable.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:40.920
Not really.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:45.320
I feel like I’m someone who’s been cursed—

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:49.120
only allowed a brief moment of happiness, and that’s it.

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:53.880
Once I return to the real world,

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:59.720
I have to go back to being strong—

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:07.040
taking care of the resort,

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:10.880
looking after my younger sibling,

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:14.960
and the dozens of staff who depend on me.

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:21.520
The resort my parents built with their own hands...

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.600
Is it still something to be jealous of?

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:36.720
I still think it’s something to envy.

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:40.120
Because at the very least,

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:41.920
your parents...

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:45.640
left you something.

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:47.680
That means,

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:51.440
while they were alive,

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:54.160
they loved you

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.960
and your sibling—deeply.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.480
That’s true.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.200
So don’t ever think that,

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:08.080
what you’re doing is pointless or meaningless.

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:11.800
Can’t you see?

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:14.560
Everyone around you is

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:19.720
ready to give you their love.

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:25.040
Not everyone, though.

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:29.200
There’s one person—

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:32.720
no matter how kind I am to her,

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:40.520
it’s like she doesn’t even notice.

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:47.000
It’s left me confused and lost.

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.520
Sounds like we’re the same.

00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:59.120
You’ve felt the same way?

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:01.320
Yes.

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:08.800
And I think I’ll have to live with it for the rest of my life.

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:14.400
Because I’ve made my choice.

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:17.640
There’s no going back.

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:20.720
And even if

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:23.040
I did turn back...

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:26.240
I wouldn’t know where to begin.

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.240
I’m sorry.

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:36.960
It’s okay.

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:41.280
So from now on,

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:44.480
let’s be each other’s support.

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:47.600
Okay.

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:27.120
I’m really sorry, Lalin. I can’t come to see you today.

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:58.320
Why are you giving me this?

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:00.520
I wasn’t crying.

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:04.120
I just saw you looking down…

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.400
I’m fine.

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:12.960
Why aren’t you home yet?

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.440
I was waiting for a friend… but they already left.

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:22.720
What about you, how are you getting home?

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:24.400
Want me to walk you back?

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:28.760
I can go home by myself.

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:31.880
If you walk me back, you’ll have to walk back alone.

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:36.760
Can I at least keep you company for a bit?

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:51.280
Can I walk with you like this every day?

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:56.600
I usually go home with my friends. I don’t want to bother you.

00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:59.880
But I want you to bother me.

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:02.200
Huh?

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:08.760
Lately I haven’t been understanding my schoolwork at all…

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:11.080
Can you help teach me?

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:14.600
Of course.

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:22.600
And how long are you planning to stand here smiling?

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.640
Your parents will be worried. You better head home now.

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:41.560
Okay, let’s wrap it up for today.

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:44.480
Don’t forget to review what we learned.

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:47.000
Next time, we’ll have a test on

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.200
consumer media behavior.

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:53.360
Okay, see you next time.

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:55.880
Thank you.

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:08.360
Kanit, aren’t you going to eat?

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:11.120
I’m not hungry yet. You guys go ahead, I’ll catch up later.

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:14.720
Are you okay? You look a bit pale.

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:17.440
I’m fine, feeling great.

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:22.560
Alright, then we’ll go eat first.

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:26.440
Let’s go eat!

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.800
How are you, my dear? Have you eaten and taken your medicine yet?

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:57.560
All done, Mom. Don’t worry, okay?

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:01.720
Drink lots of water. If you don’t feel well, come home, my dear.

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:05.400
Got it, Madam!

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:27.040
My headache’s about to explode right now.

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:29.360
- True.
- Tuk, take me somewhere to eat something spicy.

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:32.280
Yeah, let’s go! I want something spicy too.

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:35.960
Jin, want to grab some spicy food with us?

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:39.600
I’m not really hungry. You and Som go ahead and eat.

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:44.360
I was just trying to find someone to split the bill with.

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:45.880
We’ll go fifty-fifty.

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:46.680
Okay.

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:48.800
Then I’ll treat you.

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:51.160
It’s okay, Ms.Lalin.

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:53.400
We just got my monthly allowance from your dad.

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:54.960
so we don’t want to trouble you.

00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:58.560
Alright, I’ll excuse myself to the restroom first.

00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:00.360
I’ll catch up later. You all go ahead.

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:05.080
Okay, but hurry back in case you change your mind and want something spicy.

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:08.120
eah, then you can help split the bill too.

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:09.960
Okay, I’ll catch up.

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:11.800
Bye!

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:52.320
Ms.Lalin, would you like to split the bill with us?

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:53.560
Want to join us?

00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:55.840
Spicy food, It really wakes you up.

00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:57.400
That sounds good.

00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:58.600
Okay.

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:00.200
Let’s sit at this table.

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:06.040
The spicy salad looks delicious too.

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:32.000
Aren’t you going to eat?

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:34.640
I’m not hungry yet.

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:39.760
So why did you come here?

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:42.520
I saw you lying here alone,

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:44.480
so I came to keep you company.

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:47.360
Then I’ll just take a little more nap.

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:48.600
My headache hurts.

00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:51.600
You go ahead and rest. I’ll stay here with you.

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:26.840
Ms.Lalin, can you help me?

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:28.160
Thank you.

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:32.640
Wait, huh?

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:37.880
Isn’t that what the doctor-to-be bought for you?

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:41.240
Probably, yes.

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:46.200
Of course! Healthy water like that—

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:48.000
Take care and stay healthy.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.200
Jealous, when will the two of us have something like that?

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:55.560
Yes, I want to feel like—

00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:58.120
love makes people blind or something like that.

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:21.080
Are you blind or what? Walking around without paying attention.

00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:23.760
With so much stuff around, you’re just walking around daydreaming.

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:26.120
Do you think you’re the center of the universe?

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:29.120
After all that talking, you still haven’t moved your feet.

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:43.120
I’m sorry on behalf of her.

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:01.560
Why didn’t you apologize to her earlier?

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.440
The more you stay quiet, the more she’ll complain.

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:08.080
I didn’t get the chance to apologize.

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:11.320
She was already yelling at me so much.

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:15.640
Then next time, speak up before he does.

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:19.240
Okay, Lalin.

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:21.960
By the way,

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:24.640
what did you order?

00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:27.640
If I had to guess, it’s definitely matcha.

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:31.280
Yes, matcha honey lemon.

00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:34.440
Why do you want to know?

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:39.760
No reason, just curious.

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:45.800
So, when are you free?

00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:49.480
Why, what’s up?

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:56.160
I wanted to ask if you could help tutor me a bit.

00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:59.600
I’m having trouble understanding my studies.

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:04.400
When are you free?

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:07.200
You really trust me that much?

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:10.040
I trust you a lot.

00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:14.520
Alright, eat up.

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:17.200
Chatting so much that all ice melted.

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:46.320
Are Tuk and Som really going to take on extra work?

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:49.520
I heard they want to earn money to help out their families.

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:55.800
Well, I think if they’re going to help their families,

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:57.520
they should come back and focus on school afterward.

00:35:57.520 --> 00:35:58.880
That way, they can concentrate on what really matters.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:00.960
Yes, Ms.Lalin.

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:07.480
You guys head back first. I’ll go on my own.

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:12.160
Did you make plans with someone? Is that why you're telling us to go first?

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:19.560
No need to answer.

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:22.040
Your face already said everything.

00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:24.280
Let’s go.

00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:25.680
Okay.

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:27.280
Bye-bye!

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:28.960
Get home safe!

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.480
I have to apologize again for today. I’m really busy. I miss you.

00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:26.320
Thanks.

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:38.560
Are you waiting for that handsome guy?

00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:46.960
I’m sorry if I’m prying into your personal life.

00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:59.280
Aren’t you going home yet?

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:02.320
I am.

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:04.880
But I wanted to stay with you for a bit first.

00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:18.200
Why? Your handsome guy didn’t come see you?

00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:20.880
I don’t know.

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:26.520
Are you two dating yet?

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:29.840
Not yet.

00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:38.800
Then can I…

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:41.880
Why do you have to get involved in other people’s personal business?

00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:45.480
If you want to keep me company, can you just sit quietly?

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:53.080
I’m sorry.

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:11.400
Why do you have to get involved in other people’s personal business?

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:15.000
If you want to keep me company, can you just sit quietly?

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.080
Miss Happiness

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:41.240
You don’t have to treat me.

00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:43.400
I’m just here to keep you company.

00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:50.400
But you were with me when I was sick.

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:52.840
That already means a lot to me.

00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:56.880
But it’s expensive… I feel bad.

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.080
It’s not expensive at all.

00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:01.640
Come on, eat.

00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:57.200
I can eat by myself.

00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:04.040
You’re always being too polite.

00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:06.840
If you don’t eat, I’ll feed you every bite myself!

00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:10.400
Okay, okay, I’ll eat.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.960
I’m eating now, not holding back anymore!

00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:15.120
Great!

00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:32.200
Is it good?

00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:37.600
It’s actually really good.

00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:39.520
Of course!

00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:41.680
Aren’t you going to eat too?

00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:04.440
It’s good.

00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:06.800
Right? It is good!

00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:39.520
Lalin!

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:41.840
Are you ready?

00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:45.560
If you’re not ready, I’m leaving now.

00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:47.040
Wait!

00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:49.960
I’m ready—super ready!

00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:51.840
I’ll focus hard during our tutoring session!

00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:56.000
Alright then,

00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:58.080
what part do you want me to tutor you on?

00:44:59.080 --> 00:44:59.760
This part.

00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:05.400
This one, right?

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:09.760
The concepts, theories, and importance of international business in today’s world.

00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:12.760
So there are five main theories.

00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:16.120
The first one is the Comparative Advantage Theory,

00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:18.360
Comparative Advantage Theory,

00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:21.800
which plays a really important role

00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:23.720
in the era of international business.

00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:46.880
Lalin?

00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:52.720
If you’re not dating that handsome guy yet…

00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:58.440
Can I be your girlfriend instead?

00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:16.760
Did I sleep for long just now?

00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:19.560
Long enough to give me a sore shoulder.

00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:22.960
I didn’t sleep at all last night.

00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:26.640
I’m sorry for the way I spoke to you yesterday.

00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:32.040
It’s okay.

00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:17.600
You’re in such a good mood today.

00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:21.360
If it were before, I’d have gotten scolded till my ears rang.

00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:23.520
Are you feeling okay?

00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:25.200
I’m fine.

00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:27.680
But if you want to yell, I’m ready.

00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:28.800
No need. It’s all good.

00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:31.120
Hello, everyone!

00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:33.680
We’re the travel couple—

00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:35.760
I'm Tan and Achi.

00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:39.840
Mr.Tan, Mr.Ashi

00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:41.880
Thank you so much.

00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:44.400
Look, now.

00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:47.920
Not helping us at all anymore.

00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:51.240
Hey, tone it down a bit.

00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:53.840
Just because Jin’s been helping a little doesn’t mean you can slack off.

00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:56.000
Maybe I should deduct both of your salaries and give it all to Jin instead. What do you think?

00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:57.240
Please don’t, Ms.Kanit!
