00:01:22.374 --> 00:01:24.209
Who's representing the plaintiff?

00:01:24.793 --> 00:01:26.378
I'm Ahn Juhyeong

00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:29.464
with Law Group Hyungmin,
attorney for plaintiff Cha Jeongho.

00:01:29.548 --> 00:01:31.383
Who's representing the defendant?

00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:34.052
Are you the party in question?

00:01:34.136 --> 00:01:35.137
Yes.

00:01:35.804 --> 00:01:36.805
I'm…

00:01:38.432 --> 00:01:39.725
Park Sujeong.

00:01:40.893 --> 00:01:42.978
Okay, please take a seat.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.113
The plaintiff is filing only for divorce,

00:01:53.906 --> 00:01:58.785
and the defendant is counter suing
for alimony and asset division.

00:02:00.162 --> 00:02:01.914
You do agree to the divorce, correct?

00:02:02.581 --> 00:02:03.582
Yes.

00:02:05.626 --> 00:02:06.627
Defendant,

00:02:07.544 --> 00:02:11.465
there's no specific reason
or basis provided for the counter suit,

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:15.636
so the plaintiff has nothing
to respond to right now.

00:02:16.136 --> 00:02:18.805
Please have that part prepared
by the next court date.

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:21.475
And the plaintiff
will respond accordingly.

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:23.268
Yes, Your Honor.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:27.981
Defendant,

00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:29.900
you can't be crying already.

00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:31.485
This is just the first trial.

00:02:33.237 --> 00:02:34.988
Then, we'll continue this trial later.

00:02:35.072 --> 00:02:37.449
The next court date
will be on the 19th of December…

00:02:51.463 --> 00:02:55.217
Episode 4 None of My Business

00:03:28.292 --> 00:03:29.501
Hey.

00:03:29.585 --> 00:03:32.421
Do you know why this dish
is called <i>jjimdak </i>and not <i>dakjjim?</i>

00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:34.339
Why?

00:03:34.423 --> 00:03:36.216
I don't know. I was asking you.

00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:38.343
I mean, it's different

00:03:38.427 --> 00:03:40.095
- from <i>galbijjim </i>and <i>agujjim</i>.
- Idiot.

00:03:42.848 --> 00:03:44.892
Hey, did you change your phone case?

00:03:46.768 --> 00:03:48.187
Of course, you'd pick that one.

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.231
Where did you get it?
My grandfather would love one too.

00:03:51.315 --> 00:03:52.357
You punk.

00:03:52.441 --> 00:03:54.985
Hey, this thing's great.
It can hold everything.

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:56.653
Are you going to cut this forever?

00:03:56.737 --> 00:03:59.156
I'm chopping it up,
so we can eat it with a spoon.

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:02.534
Yeah, chop it up into bits
so it's easier for Grandpa Sanggi to eat.

00:04:02.618 --> 00:04:04.244
That's enough nonsense, you brat!

00:04:05.412 --> 00:04:06.455
Attorney Ha?

00:04:07.206 --> 00:04:08.707
Hello, Director!

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.293
I had some business nearby
and just grabbed a bite here.

00:04:11.376 --> 00:04:14.046
- I see!
- Enjoy your meal.

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:15.756
Have a good day, Attorney Ha.

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:17.883
I'll be in touch. All right.

00:04:19.635 --> 00:04:23.096
Gosh, what a warm smile.
How about doing that for me too?

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.389
I am doing it, you punk.

00:04:24.473 --> 00:04:25.682
What more do you want?

00:04:25.766 --> 00:04:27.100
It's all ready now.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.186
Let's eat.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:34.691
Okay.

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.573
- You saw me earlier, right?
- I didn't.

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:43.450
I didn't say where though.

00:04:43.534 --> 00:04:46.495
I'm sure it was family court.
It's the only place I went to today.

00:04:46.578 --> 00:04:50.040
Gosh, you're so confident.
You really didn't see me?

00:04:56.338 --> 00:04:57.798
What's with you?

00:04:58.549 --> 00:05:00.759
Sorry about that. Excuse us.

00:05:00.843 --> 00:05:02.928
Damn it. Is it because it's winter again?

00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:07.057
Your snot's hanging out. It's gross.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.851
Hey, we're eating here. That's nasty.

00:05:08.934 --> 00:05:11.395
- This cut-up stuff better be good.
- Try it.

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:13.814
- So delicious.
- You little…

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:17.359
Want some? The cucumbers too?

00:05:18.902 --> 00:05:20.153
That was good.

00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:24.074
- Which cafe should we go to?
- I'm going to visit the clinic.

00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:25.868
- Okay, bye.
- All right, later.

00:05:26.952 --> 00:05:28.829
- So which cafe?
- I'm busy too, so I'm off.

00:05:28.912 --> 00:05:30.289
You too?

00:05:30.372 --> 00:05:31.665
Hey, where should we go?

00:05:31.748 --> 00:05:33.250
I was thinking of this spot.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.545
Huiji. You're coming, right?

00:05:36.628 --> 00:05:39.381
What? I'm busy too. Bye.

00:05:40.799 --> 00:05:41.800
What?

00:05:44.094 --> 00:05:45.304
It's just the two of us.

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:48.765
This wasn't expected.

00:05:49.308 --> 00:05:50.434
Let's go to that spot.

00:06:03.739 --> 00:06:07.910
ATTORNEY AHN JUHYEONG

00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:19.004
DIVORCE

00:06:19.087 --> 00:06:22.049
PLAINTIFF CHA JEONGHO
DEFENDANT PARK SUJEONG

00:06:48.951 --> 00:06:50.285
Hello, Attorney Ahn.

00:06:50.369 --> 00:06:52.913
Hello. We had the divorce trial
this morning.

00:06:52.996 --> 00:06:54.206
How did it go?

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:56.041
<i>There wasn't much progress.</i>

00:06:56.124 --> 00:07:00.003
<i>The judge told the defendant
to provide a specific reason or basis,</i>

00:07:00.087 --> 00:07:02.548
<i>so they'll probably submit that
by the next trial.</i>

00:07:03.757 --> 00:07:06.385
She didn't write anything down,

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:09.012
because there's no reason
to ask for alimony.

00:07:11.181 --> 00:07:13.058
She didn't say anything weird, right?

00:07:13.141 --> 00:07:14.935
No, nothing out of the ordinary.

00:07:15.018 --> 00:07:18.480
<i>I guess we'll just wait then
and see what she submits.</i>

00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:20.941
Good work.

00:07:22.609 --> 00:07:23.777
Thank you. Goodbye.

00:08:00.397 --> 00:08:01.732
You saw me earlier, right?

00:08:02.232 --> 00:08:03.233
I didn't.

00:08:06.445 --> 00:08:08.197
He's impossible to figure out.

00:08:20.375 --> 00:08:22.127
Since when do you drink hot coffee?

00:08:23.253 --> 00:08:24.671
I lowered my standards for you.

00:08:27.799 --> 00:08:28.967
Sitting here like this

00:08:29.468 --> 00:08:32.095
makes it seem like
we're the only ones with nothing to do.

00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:34.348
They're just acting super busy.

00:08:35.724 --> 00:08:37.351
We're on the same page for once.

00:08:37.935 --> 00:08:40.354
I dumbed down
the conversation quality for you.

00:08:41.688 --> 00:08:44.650
Thank you very much.

00:08:52.491 --> 00:08:55.035
I recently saw my father
since he was in the area.

00:08:55.118 --> 00:08:56.119
Right.

00:08:56.787 --> 00:08:59.331
He started going on
about Hanguk Group again.

00:08:59.998 --> 00:09:02.376
Seriously, I'm so sick of it.

00:09:03.085 --> 00:09:05.546
Is he still pushing you
to be their in-house counsel?

00:09:08.423 --> 00:09:10.926
Actually, he didn't bring it up this time.

00:09:11.009 --> 00:09:12.010
That's good progress.

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:14.638
- Hey.
- What?

00:09:14.721 --> 00:09:15.889
What does your father do?

00:09:15.973 --> 00:09:17.808
- My father? Why?
- What do you mean "Why?"

00:09:17.891 --> 00:09:20.561
You know about my father,
but I don't know about yours.

00:09:20.644 --> 00:09:22.312
Then, you can continue to not know.

00:09:22.396 --> 00:09:23.897
Come on. What does he do?

00:09:25.482 --> 00:09:26.483
Hey!

00:09:27.276 --> 00:09:29.069
What does your father do?

00:09:29.152 --> 00:09:31.655
He's taking it easy. He's retired.

00:09:32.739 --> 00:09:33.740
Really?

00:09:34.324 --> 00:09:35.534
Tell him to get some rest.

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:49.923
- You always turn up at this time of year.
- I know, right?

00:09:50.007 --> 00:09:53.177
They're typical seasonal allergies,
so I'll prescribe your usual meds.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.138
- The meds last time were fine, right?
- Yes, they helped.

00:09:57.848 --> 00:09:59.892
I'll prescribe the same ones then.

00:10:00.851 --> 00:10:02.644
You're not pregnant or anything, right?

00:10:02.728 --> 00:10:04.313
No, I'm not.

00:10:04.396 --> 00:10:05.397
Here you go.

00:10:06.982 --> 00:10:08.442
Okay, wait just a moment.

00:10:08.525 --> 00:10:09.526
Okay.

00:10:31.298 --> 00:10:34.760
SELF-SERVICE MOTEL

00:10:57.616 --> 00:10:58.867
The marriage certificate

00:10:58.951 --> 00:11:01.078
- should be under that.
- I see.

00:11:01.161 --> 00:11:04.081
DEATH CERTIFICATE
MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE

00:11:05.332 --> 00:11:09.670
It seems the victim passed
about nine months ago.

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:12.297
Was that on the same day as the accident?

00:11:12.381 --> 00:11:14.466
Yes, they said she died instantly.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:17.845
- And the perpetrator?
- Song?

00:11:17.928 --> 00:11:18.929
Yes.

00:11:19.805 --> 00:11:21.348
He died the next day.

00:11:24.017 --> 00:11:27.271
How did you learn
that the perpetrator was drunk driving?

00:11:27.354 --> 00:11:28.730
The police told me.

00:11:29.439 --> 00:11:31.692
He was drunk enough to lose his license.

00:11:31.775 --> 00:11:33.652
- I see.
- It's weird, isn't it?

00:11:34.319 --> 00:11:36.488
The driver was wasted and crashed the car,

00:11:37.322 --> 00:11:39.408
but while the passenger died instantly,

00:11:40.033 --> 00:11:42.953
he stuck around one more day.

00:11:43.871 --> 00:11:46.957
Yes. By the way…

00:11:47.457 --> 00:11:50.878
Did the victim have alcohol
in her system as well?

00:11:50.961 --> 00:11:52.588
Yes, it was at a similar level.

00:11:55.549 --> 00:11:57.634
Now that hear it, it's pretty ridiculous.

00:11:57.718 --> 00:11:58.719
What do you mean?

00:11:58.802 --> 00:12:02.181
They were both drunk.
One drove and one was a passenger.

00:12:02.264 --> 00:12:03.599
They were both in the wrong.

00:12:05.851 --> 00:12:07.769
But since he drove, he's the perpetrator.

00:12:08.687 --> 00:12:09.980
And she died as a passenger,

00:12:10.689 --> 00:12:12.316
so she's the victim.

00:12:14.193 --> 00:12:16.028
I mean, thanks to that,

00:12:17.029 --> 00:12:19.948
I can file for damages against him.

00:12:22.159 --> 00:12:24.703
Yes, I guess you could see it that way.

00:12:24.786 --> 00:12:26.788
How do I file for damages?

00:12:26.872 --> 00:12:27.873
Right.

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:31.335
If you decide to file for damages,

00:12:31.418 --> 00:12:32.920
you can demand compensation

00:12:33.003 --> 00:12:35.047
from Song Yeongcheol
for your wife's death.

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:36.590
But he's dead.

00:12:37.257 --> 00:12:38.342
Yes, that's right.

00:12:38.425 --> 00:12:41.011
So we would file the claim
against his family,

00:12:41.094 --> 00:12:42.429
who are his legal heirs.

00:12:42.513 --> 00:12:43.722
I see.

00:12:45.057 --> 00:12:47.518
So it's the people left behind
suing each other.

00:12:49.478 --> 00:12:50.479
Yes.

00:12:52.856 --> 00:12:55.108
Also, as you mentioned,

00:12:55.192 --> 00:12:58.028
your wife was responsible
for enabling the drunk driving,

00:12:58.111 --> 00:13:00.489
so compensation will be reduced
because of that.

00:13:00.572 --> 00:13:03.408
Don't say she's my wife.
Just call her the victim.

00:13:04.076 --> 00:13:05.077
No.

00:13:06.286 --> 00:13:07.538
I'm the victim here.

00:13:08.372 --> 00:13:09.373
Sir?

00:13:09.456 --> 00:13:11.708
Do you know where the crash happened?

00:13:13.961 --> 00:13:15.379
Right outside a motel strip.

00:13:17.172 --> 00:13:18.882
They were in such a hurry

00:13:20.592 --> 00:13:22.886
that they didn't slow down
after getting there.

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:29.101
Right, so…

00:13:29.184 --> 00:13:32.229
There are two claims
you can file for compensation.

00:13:32.312 --> 00:13:36.316
One for the affair
and one for your wife's death.

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:39.361
Is there anything you know
about the perpetrators' family?

00:13:39.444 --> 00:13:40.696
Like who his legal heir is?

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:44.283
He has a wife, a daughter, and a son.

00:13:45.325 --> 00:13:46.618
That bastard had kids.

00:13:48.036 --> 00:13:52.165
Then, we'll proceed by naming his wife
and children as defendants.

00:13:52.249 --> 00:13:53.625
In the lawsuit.

00:13:53.709 --> 00:13:57.421
I heard both his kids
aren't even 10 years old yet.

00:13:57.504 --> 00:13:58.672
Should we leave them out?

00:14:06.847 --> 00:14:07.848
Let's include them.

00:14:07.931 --> 00:14:11.018
If you only file against his wife,

00:14:11.101 --> 00:14:14.146
your claim is limited
three-sevenths of the full amount.

00:14:14.229 --> 00:14:15.856
And as I mentioned before,

00:14:15.939 --> 00:14:19.234
if we consider the reduction
from the victim's aiding of drunk driving,

00:14:19.318 --> 00:14:21.361
you'll be looking at even less.

00:14:22.362 --> 00:14:24.406
Without the kids, the amount is too low.

00:14:27.618 --> 00:14:28.744
Okay, let's do that.

00:14:29.494 --> 00:14:30.704
Please file it right away.

00:14:30.787 --> 00:14:31.955
I will, sir.

00:14:57.231 --> 00:14:59.525
PREGNANCY TEST

00:15:45.195 --> 00:15:46.864
Why is everyone so down?

00:15:48.031 --> 00:15:50.200
Why?

00:15:51.451 --> 00:15:53.912
What should we do?
Want to get drunk after work?

00:15:54.496 --> 00:15:55.914
- No.
- No.

00:15:55.998 --> 00:15:58.542
Yeah, I didn't want to either.

00:16:00.127 --> 00:16:02.546
I'm a little tired.
Who even drinks these days?

00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:03.881
I told you to stay quiet.

00:16:03.964 --> 00:16:05.048
When?

00:16:05.132 --> 00:16:06.133
I just did.

00:16:06.592 --> 00:16:07.593
What?

00:16:13.473 --> 00:16:15.434
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:16:15.517 --> 00:16:16.852
- We meet again.
- Yes.

00:16:16.935 --> 00:16:19.146
Don't mind me.
Please relax and eat.

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:33.869
ADVISOR KIM HYUNGMIN

00:16:33.952 --> 00:16:36.330
Wait. You two are close now?

00:16:36.413 --> 00:16:38.040
We ran into each other a few times.

00:16:38.123 --> 00:16:41.168
Look at you.
You're such a social butterfly.

00:16:42.753 --> 00:16:43.962
I'm getting competitive.

00:16:44.046 --> 00:16:46.215
Step it up, Changwon!
I need to work harder.

00:16:53.055 --> 00:16:54.181
Did you call me, sir?

00:16:54.264 --> 00:16:56.183
This is the lawyer I mentioned.

00:16:56.266 --> 00:16:59.353
Of all the attorneys at our firm,
he's the perfect fit.

00:16:59.436 --> 00:17:01.813
- You know, we occupy this whole building.
- Right.

00:17:01.897 --> 00:17:03.732
Say hello to Chairman Jang Gwanggi.

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:06.401
Hello, I'm Cho Changwon.

00:17:07.152 --> 00:17:08.320
Yes, nice to meet you.

00:17:09.071 --> 00:17:10.489
You're pretty handsome.

00:17:11.365 --> 00:17:12.533
- Have a seat.
- Yes, sir.

00:17:13.116 --> 00:17:15.619
He's got a real knack for conversation.

00:17:16.411 --> 00:17:18.247
Your son won't be bored at all.

00:17:20.749 --> 00:17:21.750
So…

00:17:23.043 --> 00:17:24.378
I have a favor to ask.

00:17:26.255 --> 00:17:28.841
I have a son

00:17:29.675 --> 00:17:30.843
that I can't just ignore.

00:17:32.177 --> 00:17:33.428
He keeps complaining

00:17:33.512 --> 00:17:36.348
about how tough life is
in the detention center.

00:17:36.932 --> 00:17:38.809
Just until his trial's done,

00:17:39.643 --> 00:17:40.894
can you keep him company?

00:17:42.646 --> 00:17:43.647
Yes, sir.

00:17:45.858 --> 00:17:49.111
It's nothing big. It's just a quick visit
for an hour each day.

00:17:49.194 --> 00:17:52.447
The chairman's son
has been wrongly accused,

00:17:52.531 --> 00:17:54.032
so he's currently in custody.

00:17:54.908 --> 00:17:57.828
But life in detention is tough. Poor kid.

00:17:59.538 --> 00:18:03.375
So are you saying
we're taking on his case?

00:18:05.961 --> 00:18:06.962
No.

00:18:08.422 --> 00:18:11.216
That's being handled by another firm,
so don't worry about it.

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:15.304
Just go and talk about what's going on
in the world for an hour.

00:18:19.808 --> 00:18:20.976
Okay.

00:18:24.563 --> 00:18:25.606
WRITTEN STATEMENT

00:18:25.689 --> 00:18:27.983
PLAINTIFF CHA JEONGHO
DEFENDANT PARK SUJEONG

00:18:35.616 --> 00:18:37.492
DEFENDANT PARK SUJEONG

00:18:41.288 --> 00:18:42.289
I'm coming in.

00:18:44.791 --> 00:18:45.792
Hey.

00:18:45.876 --> 00:18:48.921
You said you'd trade your divorce case
for my sale proceeds case.

00:18:49.004 --> 00:18:50.756
- What happened?
- Oh, that.

00:18:51.298 --> 00:18:53.634
I talked with Mr. Na,
but I decided to just keep it.

00:18:53.717 --> 00:18:56.220
What the hell?
You got my hopes up for nothing.

00:18:57.221 --> 00:18:59.181
That sales proceeds case is so difficult.

00:18:59.264 --> 00:19:01.642
If you're stuck, bring it over.
I'll help you.

00:19:02.893 --> 00:19:04.603
Why did you want to switch at first?

00:19:04.686 --> 00:19:07.397
- You said I'd find out once I started.
- It's nothing.

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:10.067
What? Fine.

00:19:10.817 --> 00:19:13.028
I'll need your help later. See you.

00:19:32.714 --> 00:19:33.966
You're a little late.

00:19:34.842 --> 00:19:37.135
Yes, I was stuck in traffic.

00:19:45.352 --> 00:19:46.353
Did she submit this?

00:19:46.436 --> 00:19:49.189
Yes. It's a written statement
submitted by Park Sujeong.

00:19:51.775 --> 00:19:53.235
She wrote down a lot.

00:19:55.112 --> 00:19:56.113
What does it say?

00:19:57.447 --> 00:20:00.868
It says you were physically
and verbally abusive during the marriage.

00:20:05.956 --> 00:20:07.624
DEFENDANT WAS PHYSICALLY ASSAULTED

00:20:07.708 --> 00:20:09.209
DEFENDANT WAS VERBALLY ABUSED

00:20:14.214 --> 00:20:16.508
This is it? Where's the evidence?

00:20:16.592 --> 00:20:18.635
She didn't submit any evidence.

00:20:21.471 --> 00:20:23.223
There's no actual evidence then?

00:20:27.895 --> 00:20:30.397
Did you assault her?

00:20:33.984 --> 00:20:36.528
Does it matter? There's no evidence.

00:20:36.612 --> 00:20:39.198
If it's true, now is the time to speak up.

00:20:39.281 --> 00:20:42.701
That way, I can respond properly.

00:20:44.369 --> 00:20:45.370
It's not true.

00:20:47.372 --> 00:20:50.918
Even according to her,
it was just one time, not multiple.

00:20:51.001 --> 00:20:52.336
So not even once?

00:20:57.216 --> 00:20:58.383
No.

00:20:59.801 --> 00:21:01.053
Not by my standards.

00:21:05.599 --> 00:21:07.893
- What about verbal abuse?
- I didn't do that either.

00:21:07.976 --> 00:21:10.020
Not by my standards.

00:21:19.196 --> 00:21:20.197
All right.

00:21:20.906 --> 00:21:25.160
I'll submit a written statement
firmly denying everything on that premise.

00:21:26.954 --> 00:21:29.248
What? You don't believe me?

00:21:29.331 --> 00:21:32.125
Whether I believe you or not
isn't that important.

00:21:32.209 --> 00:21:34.169
How is that not important?

00:21:35.796 --> 00:21:39.508
How can I let someone represent me
if they don't believe me?

00:21:44.096 --> 00:21:48.851
My job is to help you properly exercise
your right to defend yourself.

00:21:49.935 --> 00:21:53.522
What I believe
doesn't change how I do my job.

00:21:53.605 --> 00:21:55.148
So don't worry about that.

00:22:21.633 --> 00:22:24.720
Since the plaintiff's wife
died instantly in the accident,

00:22:24.803 --> 00:22:28.765
there's no basis for a claim
against the defendant's husband.

00:22:28.849 --> 00:22:31.768
A deceased person
can't be granted any legal rights.

00:22:33.145 --> 00:22:34.897
The Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:38.400
that even in cases of instant death,
the right to claim damages

00:22:38.483 --> 00:22:41.486
is still recognized in that brief moment.

00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:43.530
Kim Minkyung knew
Mr. Song was drunk driving

00:22:43.614 --> 00:22:45.449
but turned a blind eye to it,

00:22:45.532 --> 00:22:47.201
so that fault reduces the payout.

00:22:47.284 --> 00:22:49.995
That said,
the plaintiff's claim for damages

00:22:50.078 --> 00:22:52.915
has nothing to do with drunk driving.

00:22:52.998 --> 00:22:57.419
The claim also includes
compensation for the affair,

00:22:57.503 --> 00:23:00.047
so that needs to be assessed separately.

00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:04.343
Okay, all of that
is already in the written submission,

00:23:04.426 --> 00:23:05.552
so let's leave it there.

00:23:06.428 --> 00:23:09.681
The defendants haven't renounced
their inheritance, correct?

00:23:10.265 --> 00:23:14.770
No, Your Honor. The house and other assets
are under Mr. Song's name,

00:23:15.562 --> 00:23:19.107
so the defendants couldn't renounce it
based on their living conditions.

00:23:20.484 --> 00:23:23.320
In this case, neither the plaintiff
nor the defendants

00:23:23.403 --> 00:23:25.822
are the real parties here.

00:23:26.406 --> 00:23:29.785
If anything,
they're all just victims of the affair.

00:23:34.456 --> 00:23:35.457
Let's do this.

00:23:35.541 --> 00:23:38.460
We'll schedule a preparatory hearing,

00:23:38.544 --> 00:23:41.463
and I'll try to mediate directly then,

00:23:41.547 --> 00:23:44.466
so make sure both the plaintiff
and the defendants attend.

00:23:46.176 --> 00:23:48.804
But we'll exclude the defendants
who are minors.

00:23:49.388 --> 00:23:51.348
Just have Lee Sujin attend.

00:23:52.891 --> 00:23:54.852
Yes, Your Honor.
I'll talk to the plaintiff.

00:23:58.146 --> 00:24:02.067
We've actually discussed this before,
but I'm not sure if she will come.

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:03.318
Well then,

00:24:03.402 --> 00:24:05.696
please do your best to persuade her.

00:24:05.779 --> 00:24:07.197
Yes, Your Honor.

00:24:07.281 --> 00:24:09.074
The same goes for plaintiff's counsel.

00:24:09.157 --> 00:24:10.367
Yes, Your Honor. I will.

00:24:11.201 --> 00:24:15.330
Let's go home.

00:24:22.754 --> 00:24:25.090
And I got everything.

00:24:25.174 --> 00:24:30.387
ATTORNEY KANG HUIJI

00:24:34.683 --> 00:24:35.684
PRESIDENT KIM

00:24:37.728 --> 00:24:38.729
Hello?

00:24:40.647 --> 00:24:43.150
Me? I'm clocking out.

00:24:44.193 --> 00:24:45.277
Yeah.

00:25:05.756 --> 00:25:07.799
Dad, what brings you here?

00:25:08.383 --> 00:25:10.636
I just happened
to be passing by your office.

00:25:10.719 --> 00:25:13.347
And you weren't circling the block
for the tenth time?

00:25:14.181 --> 00:25:16.225
Hey, your dad's not that sweet, okay?

00:25:18.227 --> 00:25:19.436
Put your seat belt on.

00:25:34.576 --> 00:25:37.454
- All right, let's go.
- Okay.

00:25:49.049 --> 00:25:51.510
Aren't you exhausted
from working late every day?

00:25:52.469 --> 00:25:54.721
You've been so busy
since you became a lawyer.

00:25:55.222 --> 00:25:56.682
No, I'm okay.

00:25:57.182 --> 00:25:58.392
I enjoy the work.

00:25:58.934 --> 00:26:01.061
I have to put in the hours now
to learn fast.

00:26:02.062 --> 00:26:04.940
Hey, it's not like
we live far away or anything.

00:26:05.023 --> 00:26:07.192
We're a stone's throw away,
so visit more often.

00:26:07.818 --> 00:26:09.236
Your mom misses you.

00:26:09.903 --> 00:26:13.240
If she misses me, she should just call.

00:26:13.323 --> 00:26:15.701
You know your mom's the shy type.

00:26:16.201 --> 00:26:17.828
Since when?

00:26:18.871 --> 00:26:21.373
She figures you're busy. That's why.

00:26:22.624 --> 00:26:23.750
I know.

00:26:26.837 --> 00:26:29.214
I liked it more
when you played piano.

00:26:29.298 --> 00:26:32.384
You came home more often
and didn't work this late.

00:26:33.677 --> 00:26:35.971
Don't most parents prefer
their kids to be lawyers?

00:26:37.806 --> 00:26:40.434
If this is what you want,
that's all that matters to us.

00:26:41.143 --> 00:26:42.144
Then, we're good.

00:26:46.273 --> 00:26:49.318
But are you sure
this is what you wanted to do?

00:26:51.528 --> 00:26:55.782
I've wondered if you suddenly
went into law because of me.

00:26:56.742 --> 00:26:58.243
It's been weighing on me.

00:27:00.787 --> 00:27:02.456
You're so full of yourself.

00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:05.667
I'm not that sweet, you know.

00:27:06.627 --> 00:27:07.628
Then, we're good.

00:27:08.921 --> 00:27:10.714
Are you coming for memorial rites?

00:27:12.132 --> 00:27:15.302
It's already been 25 years
since your parents passed.

00:27:17.387 --> 00:27:19.932
Yeah, I'll be there.

00:27:40.327 --> 00:27:41.745
- Thanks.
- Sure.

00:27:45.666 --> 00:27:46.792
Go on and get some rest.

00:27:46.875 --> 00:27:48.544
Okay. Drive safe, Dad.

00:28:52.733 --> 00:28:54.526
Anyone here
for the 10:00 a.m. case?

00:28:54.610 --> 00:28:58.322
Cha Jeongho and Park Sujeong?
Okay, please come in.

00:29:23.347 --> 00:29:27.476
CASE NUMBER 2024-154671
CHA, PARK

00:29:34.233 --> 00:29:37.694
Defendant, your claims are well-organized,

00:29:38.862 --> 00:29:40.656
but you haven't submitted any evidence.

00:29:41.698 --> 00:29:44.910
Do you have anything
to support the allegations of abuse?

00:29:47.663 --> 00:29:50.082
Maybe photos of injuries

00:29:50.165 --> 00:29:52.334
or an audio recording of the verbal abuse?

00:29:52.417 --> 00:29:54.378
- Please submit them if you have any.
- Do I…

00:29:55.921 --> 00:29:57.506
Have to submit those?

00:30:00.759 --> 00:30:03.846
If you don't submit anything,
there won't be any evidence.

00:30:04.346 --> 00:30:06.431
We can't accept your claims then.

00:30:07.766 --> 00:30:10.644
Defendant, do you have
any evidence to submit?

00:30:18.694 --> 00:30:19.695
No, I don't.

00:30:20.404 --> 00:30:22.573
The plaintiff has submitted

00:30:22.656 --> 00:30:26.368
a written statement
strongly denying the abuse claims.

00:30:26.451 --> 00:30:28.161
You've received that, correct?

00:30:28.745 --> 00:30:32.207
- Yes.
- But you're saying you have no evidence.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.001
Is that correct?

00:30:37.921 --> 00:30:38.922
Yes.

00:30:42.384 --> 00:30:43.385
Your Honor.

00:30:43.969 --> 00:30:46.680
As we've already stated
in our previous brief,

00:30:46.763 --> 00:30:48.682
there was no physical or verbal abuse.

00:30:49.808 --> 00:30:51.476
The defendant has nothing more,

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:54.438
so we ask you end proceedings
and move to judgment.

00:30:56.064 --> 00:31:00.235
We can't end proceedings
at this stage just yet.

00:31:00.819 --> 00:31:03.780
It seems the evidence review
for damages is almost done.

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:07.451
Let's try another round of mediation.

00:31:08.827 --> 00:31:12.831
If it doesn't work this time,
we'll resume proceedings…

00:31:18.045 --> 00:31:19.755
MENSTRUAL CYCLE

00:31:25.344 --> 00:31:26.345
Hey, Munjeong.

00:31:27.221 --> 00:31:28.305
Hey.

00:31:28.388 --> 00:31:31.517
- Where are the others?
- Their trials have them a ways off.

00:31:32.809 --> 00:31:34.228
Even Juhyeong?

00:31:34.311 --> 00:31:36.188
I saw him at family court this morning.

00:31:36.271 --> 00:31:37.314
You saw him earlier?

00:31:37.397 --> 00:31:38.941
Yeah, just from behind.

00:31:40.067 --> 00:31:42.486
Really?
He said he won't be able to grab lunch.

00:31:45.864 --> 00:31:50.035
I guess Juhyeong
takes on his friends' cases too.

00:31:50.118 --> 00:31:53.080
When I saw him, it seemed like
he knew his client pretty well.

00:31:53.163 --> 00:31:54.665
I doubt it.

00:31:54.748 --> 00:31:58.335
That's actually
the one type of case he won't do.

00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:01.505
Really?

00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:08.595
Why do you look so down?

00:32:08.679 --> 00:32:10.055
Should we get dessert after?

00:32:10.931 --> 00:32:13.100
Why? I'm fine.

00:32:13.809 --> 00:32:15.352
Do I look tired?

00:32:16.228 --> 00:32:17.479
Dessert sounds good though.

00:32:18.605 --> 00:32:20.816
- What do you want to eat?
- Pasta and…

00:32:20.899 --> 00:32:23.193
FIND MY CASE

00:32:25.404 --> 00:32:27.322
PARK SUJEONG

00:32:29.992 --> 00:32:32.870
DIVORCE
DEFENDANT PARK SUJEONG

00:32:32.953 --> 00:32:34.204
I was right.

00:32:34.288 --> 00:32:36.623
TRIAL DATE
MEDIATION DATE

00:32:36.707 --> 00:32:39.126
A mediation date has been set.

00:32:42.379 --> 00:32:44.298
PLAINTIFF'S COUNSEL
LAW GROUP HYUNGMIN

00:32:44.381 --> 00:32:45.757
ATTORNEY IN CHARGE
AHN JUHYEONG

00:32:45.841 --> 00:32:47.134
"Plaintiff's counsel"?

00:32:48.468 --> 00:32:50.095
Not Park Sujeong's counsel?

00:33:22.711 --> 00:33:24.129
- Hi.
- Hello.

00:33:28.509 --> 00:33:30.385
You look miserable this morning.

00:33:31.762 --> 00:33:34.723
I guess I knew
someone would pick a fight this early.

00:33:59.206 --> 00:34:02.125
I saw you were handling
Park Sujeong's divorce case.

00:34:03.293 --> 00:34:04.294
Are you okay?

00:34:07.381 --> 00:34:09.007
What are you so surprised about?

00:34:09.842 --> 00:34:11.260
We ran into each other that day

00:34:11.343 --> 00:34:13.762
when you walked by
and pretended not to know me.

00:34:13.846 --> 00:34:15.389
How did you know she was Sujeong?

00:34:18.267 --> 00:34:21.103
Well, I just happened to by chance.

00:34:25.774 --> 00:34:28.485
Why would you take that case?
Just because you were told to?

00:34:28.569 --> 00:34:31.405
It's just work. Same as any other case.
I do what they give me.

00:34:31.488 --> 00:34:33.740
How is that the same?

00:34:34.616 --> 00:34:37.536
I thought you were representing her
for old times' sake.

00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:39.663
What's so different about it?

00:34:40.414 --> 00:34:43.876
Just because you act like an amateur
doesn't mean everyone else does.

00:34:45.252 --> 00:34:46.378
What you're doing

00:34:47.087 --> 00:34:48.338
isn't being professional.

00:34:48.422 --> 00:34:49.798
It's being stupid.

00:34:50.799 --> 00:34:52.384
Then, I should've whined and said,

00:34:52.467 --> 00:34:54.469
"I can't take the case
because she's my ex"?

00:34:54.553 --> 00:34:55.971
Yes, you should have.

00:34:57.389 --> 00:34:59.725
But you don't even know to say that,
so it's stupid.

00:35:02.477 --> 00:35:04.229
You can say those things all you want.

00:35:04.313 --> 00:35:06.023
But I've never worked like that.

00:35:13.697 --> 00:35:14.823
Do the others know?

00:35:17.034 --> 00:35:18.368
No, I didn't tell anyone.

00:35:27.544 --> 00:35:30.547
INVALIDITY OF DEFENDANT'S ABUSE CLAIMS

00:35:47.564 --> 00:35:49.566
WRITTEN STATEMENT

00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:02.371
It's so good.

00:36:03.872 --> 00:36:04.873
Here.

00:36:04.957 --> 00:36:07.793
- We should've went to eat pork cutlets.
- Why? This is good.

00:36:08.377 --> 00:36:10.754
This is going to make your sweater smell.

00:36:10.838 --> 00:36:11.964
Yeah, that is true.

00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:22.432
Is it good?

00:36:37.823 --> 00:36:39.157
- I have to go in here.
- Okay.

00:36:42.619 --> 00:36:43.996
I'll be right back.

00:36:44.079 --> 00:36:46.081
Okay, I'll be right here.

00:36:47.332 --> 00:36:49.334
Don't come in. It'll be embarrassing.

00:36:49.418 --> 00:36:51.920
Okay. You're going to be late. Go on in.

00:36:52.838 --> 00:36:53.881
I'll be right back.

00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:57.801
- I'll be quick.
- Okay, already.

00:37:07.853 --> 00:37:08.896
Just have a seat.

00:37:34.129 --> 00:37:35.547
How have you been?

00:37:37.591 --> 00:37:39.218
Let's avoid any personal talk.

00:37:50.312 --> 00:37:53.023
Did you have to stay on this case?

00:37:54.191 --> 00:37:56.068
You should've hired a lawyer too.

00:37:56.735 --> 00:37:58.111
Why keep showing up in person?

00:38:03.116 --> 00:38:04.535
Let's just talk about the case.

00:38:05.077 --> 00:38:07.996
Right now, I'm not Ahn Juhyeong.
I'm just Cha Jeongho's attorney.

00:38:13.877 --> 00:38:15.379
You should drop the case.

00:38:16.839 --> 00:38:19.007
Just hand it off
to another lawyer at your firm.

00:38:26.557 --> 00:38:28.308
Why should I let you

00:38:29.935 --> 00:38:31.645
find out that my marriage is a mess?

00:38:33.188 --> 00:38:34.273
Why should I?

00:38:41.613 --> 00:38:42.739
Sujeong,

00:38:44.032 --> 00:38:45.701
do everything you can.

00:38:46.535 --> 00:38:48.203
Submit all the evidence you have.

00:39:04.094 --> 00:39:05.262
I don't have any.

00:39:15.981 --> 00:39:17.357
Then, let's end this today.

00:39:18.984 --> 00:39:21.987
If you drop all your claims,
we can wrap things up right now.

00:39:32.581 --> 00:39:35.417
A BETTER TOMORROW, CORRECTION FOR HOPE

00:39:36.001 --> 00:39:37.586
- Hello.
- How can I help you?

00:39:37.669 --> 00:39:38.754
I'm here for a visit.

00:39:48.805 --> 00:39:50.224
Okay, you've been confirmed.

00:39:50.766 --> 00:39:51.767
Thank you.

00:40:02.069 --> 00:40:03.654
Hello. I'm here for a visit.

00:40:05.614 --> 00:40:07.157
One moment, please.

00:40:07.241 --> 00:40:08.617
Okay. Here you go.

00:40:14.373 --> 00:40:15.499
Sir,

00:40:16.875 --> 00:40:18.126
you can head to Room 5.

00:40:32.057 --> 00:40:33.684
ROOM 5

00:41:13.515 --> 00:41:15.017
Hello, Mr. Jang Sugil.

00:41:15.726 --> 00:41:17.269
I'm Attorney Cho Changwon.

00:41:17.352 --> 00:41:21.148
Right. Damn it. I wanted them
to send a girl, not some guy.

00:41:23.358 --> 00:41:25.277
You seem pretty disappointed.

00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:29.823
But I'm considered
the prettiest one at our firm.

00:41:31.867 --> 00:41:32.868
Yeah, I doubt that.

00:41:34.494 --> 00:41:38.040
Well, you can come out
and see for yourself.

00:41:40.667 --> 00:41:42.002
So what should we talk about?

00:41:42.085 --> 00:41:44.004
Talk about what? Goddamn it.

00:41:44.087 --> 00:41:48.091
I just wanted a female lawyer
to shoot the breeze with. Not a guy…

00:41:48.634 --> 00:41:49.718
Seriously…

00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:57.100
Fill me in on yesterday's
Champions League game then.

00:41:57.184 --> 00:41:59.895
- Who won?
- The Champions League?

00:42:00.854 --> 00:42:02.064
I don't watch soccer.

00:42:02.147 --> 00:42:03.690
Unbelievable.

00:42:04.566 --> 00:42:06.318
What kind of idiot did they send?

00:42:06.401 --> 00:42:08.153
Then, how about this?

00:42:08.904 --> 00:42:12.366
You were arrested for stock manipulation.
Let's talk about the case.

00:42:12.449 --> 00:42:13.825
I'll talk about the case

00:42:14.535 --> 00:42:16.787
with my lawyer
who's actually representing me.

00:42:17.371 --> 00:42:19.122
You're not here to represent me.

00:42:20.249 --> 00:42:22.209
You think you're here as a lawyer?

00:42:22.793 --> 00:42:24.503
You're a loser keeping me company.

00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:29.508
When does this end?

00:42:47.943 --> 00:42:50.654
- Where are you coming back from?
- I had a trial. You too?

00:42:51.446 --> 00:42:52.489
No, I…

00:42:54.241 --> 00:42:55.242
Had a prison visit.

00:42:55.826 --> 00:42:56.827
I see.

00:43:06.753 --> 00:43:07.754
What is it?

00:43:08.172 --> 00:43:09.173
What?

00:43:09.256 --> 00:43:12.342
It's just I've never seen you
with such a serious expression before.

00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:14.011
Really?

00:43:15.762 --> 00:43:18.348
Or are you not upset
and just out of energy?

00:43:19.183 --> 00:43:20.434
What, is something wrong?

00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:22.561
No.

00:43:23.145 --> 00:43:25.355
I'm just bored
because nothing's going on at all.

00:43:26.148 --> 00:43:28.942
Man, I wish I could take on
an exciting case for once.

00:43:29.026 --> 00:43:30.652
Something that feels
worth doing.

00:43:31.695 --> 00:43:33.989
What kind of case
was that prison visit for?

00:43:34.698 --> 00:43:36.074
Oh, that.

00:43:36.575 --> 00:43:37.784
Some stock manipulation.

00:43:38.785 --> 00:43:40.621
There must be a lot of victims then.

00:43:41.205 --> 00:43:44.166
The problem is,
no one knows if there's a lot or not.

00:43:45.626 --> 00:43:47.127
You didn't get the records yet?

00:43:48.045 --> 00:43:51.590
Yeah, I got them. Of course, I did.

00:43:52.966 --> 00:43:54.510
But why do I feel so gloomy?

00:43:55.219 --> 00:43:57.346
Everyone's been so down.
Maybe I caught it too.

00:43:59.014 --> 00:44:01.892
Yeah, everyone's been looking down lately.

00:44:04.436 --> 00:44:05.562
- Just in case…
- Yes?

00:44:05.646 --> 00:44:09.274
If they ask something
that's difficult to answer, I'll help out.

00:44:09.358 --> 00:44:10.692
So don't worry too much.

00:44:10.776 --> 00:44:11.860
Okay, thank you.

00:44:13.654 --> 00:44:14.780
All rise.

00:44:30.504 --> 00:44:31.588
Please be seated.

00:44:35.843 --> 00:44:39.847
I know this must be a difficult case
for you to attend in person today,

00:44:40.347 --> 00:44:43.934
so I'd like to thank both parties
for making the time to be here.

00:44:44.476 --> 00:44:45.894
Given the nature of this case,

00:44:45.978 --> 00:44:50.148
both sides were, in a way,
victims of the affair.

00:44:50.649 --> 00:44:54.736
So we felt it was best to help you
reach an agreement peacefully

00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:57.406
without causing further harm.

00:44:57.489 --> 00:44:59.366
That's why we called you here today.

00:45:00.617 --> 00:45:03.871
We know this is painful,

00:45:04.538 --> 00:45:08.292
and we hope you understand
the court deeply regrets

00:45:08.375 --> 00:45:10.335
having you to appear in person as well.

00:45:13.172 --> 00:45:15.424
Let's try to wrap this up
through mediation today.

00:45:15.507 --> 00:45:17.259
Yes, I'll do that.

00:45:22.431 --> 00:45:24.641
Did you really regret it?

00:45:27.561 --> 00:45:30.647
Do you really understand how painful

00:45:31.523 --> 00:45:32.524
this is for us?

00:45:36.653 --> 00:45:39.156
We sincerely hope this can be resolved,

00:45:39.656 --> 00:45:43.702
so both of you can move on
and start anew...

00:45:43.785 --> 00:45:45.120
Move on?

00:45:47.247 --> 00:45:50.209
Peacefully without causing further harm?

00:45:52.711 --> 00:45:54.129
You think that's possible?

00:45:54.213 --> 00:45:56.548
Do you think settling with him

00:45:57.758 --> 00:45:59.009
will fix everything?

00:46:02.012 --> 00:46:03.055
Geez.

00:46:04.556 --> 00:46:05.599
If I had just

00:46:06.767 --> 00:46:08.727
given up my inheritance,

00:46:09.770 --> 00:46:12.856
I wouldn't have had to go through
the ordeal of paying damages

00:46:13.357 --> 00:46:15.108
to my husband's mistress.

00:46:18.195 --> 00:46:20.531
But I have two kids to feed.

00:46:22.282 --> 00:46:26.745
And we need that house
under Song Yeongcheol's name to survive.

00:46:29.164 --> 00:46:30.165
I was…

00:46:30.791 --> 00:46:33.335
So pathetic
that I couldn't give up my inheritance.

00:46:35.087 --> 00:46:38.590
You have no idea how it feels
to suffer this humiliation.

00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:46.431
That's why instead of leaving it
to the court,

00:46:46.515 --> 00:46:49.351
we brought both parties here
to settle it themselves.

00:46:49.434 --> 00:46:50.853
So please try to stay calm.

00:46:50.936 --> 00:46:52.396
Are you saying

00:46:52.896 --> 00:46:55.899
if I handle things myself and settle,
I'll get a fresh start?

00:46:57.067 --> 00:47:00.445
Do you think he feels at peace right now?

00:47:09.329 --> 00:47:10.664
I mean,

00:47:12.624 --> 00:47:14.585
if this were something I did,

00:47:16.587 --> 00:47:19.464
I'd take full responsibility.

00:47:20.257 --> 00:47:25.012
But I didn't do any of this!

00:47:34.229 --> 00:47:35.647
There's no way

00:47:36.982 --> 00:47:38.275
that I can personally

00:47:39.234 --> 00:47:42.571
hand over the money
to my husband's mistress.

00:47:42.654 --> 00:47:44.615
So please, just give a verdict.

00:47:44.698 --> 00:47:47.034
Just take it from me by force.

00:47:47.117 --> 00:47:51.205
I absolutely cannot bring myself
to personally pay them.

00:48:11.225 --> 00:48:12.684
This is driving me crazy.

00:48:13.810 --> 00:48:17.981
DEFENDANT PARK SUJEONG

00:48:27.491 --> 00:48:29.910
This will confirm
that the divorce finalized

00:48:29.993 --> 00:48:31.995
and there are no remaining claims

00:48:32.079 --> 00:48:35.332
for anything owed,
such as alimony or asset division.

00:48:35.874 --> 00:48:41.463
COUNSEL AHN JUHYEONG

00:49:06.655 --> 00:49:08.532
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

00:49:09.032 --> 00:49:11.952
So in this case,
there likely will be one more trial date.

00:49:12.035 --> 00:49:14.830
If things wrap up then,
they'll set the date for the verdict.

00:49:15.664 --> 00:49:17.165
Yes, I understand.

00:49:20.335 --> 00:49:23.213
Excuse me. Thank you for your time.

00:49:28.135 --> 00:49:29.803
Does someone like you

00:49:30.679 --> 00:49:33.056
even understand how someone like me feels?

00:49:34.933 --> 00:49:36.018
Let's go now.

00:49:37.519 --> 00:49:39.479
People like you
are born into nice families

00:49:39.563 --> 00:49:41.732
and go to expensive law schools,

00:49:41.815 --> 00:49:44.526
where it's easier
to become a lawyer.

00:49:45.152 --> 00:49:47.404
How could you even relate
to something like this?

00:49:48.322 --> 00:49:49.948
You named my kids as defendants!

00:49:51.825 --> 00:49:55.120
You shouldn't live your life like that.

00:49:55.954 --> 00:49:56.997
Let's go.

00:49:59.291 --> 00:50:02.002
I looked you up to see
what kind of person you were.

00:50:02.085 --> 00:50:04.213
You're not the only one
who looked into things!

00:50:10.219 --> 00:50:12.221
- Attorney Ha.
- Yes?

00:50:12.304 --> 00:50:15.057
- Let's just go.
- Yes, let's go.

00:50:39.373 --> 00:50:42.417
The case ended in your favor,
so you won't need to come in anymore.

00:50:43.919 --> 00:50:48.215
How could I not show up
after hearing such good news?

00:50:55.347 --> 00:50:57.391
It's nothing much.
Just a gift certificate.

00:50:57.474 --> 00:50:59.268
I wanted to show my thanks.

00:51:00.394 --> 00:51:02.688
- So please take it.
- No, it's okay.

00:51:03.981 --> 00:51:04.982
Come on.

00:51:05.899 --> 00:51:07.651
Take it!

00:51:09.027 --> 00:51:12.322
You pulled off a clean win.

00:51:16.243 --> 00:51:18.287
Yes, thank you.

00:51:24.459 --> 00:51:28.380
I'm so glad I had you take the case.

00:51:31.592 --> 00:51:32.843
I made

00:51:33.677 --> 00:51:36.763
a specific request
when I talked to Mr. Na.

00:51:37.723 --> 00:51:41.810
I asked for you
to be put on my case.

00:51:43.145 --> 00:51:44.563
- Me?
- Yes.

00:51:44.646 --> 00:51:46.690
You, Attorney Ahn Juhyeong.

00:51:57.951 --> 00:52:02.748
I figured if she had to deal with her ex,
it would make her uncomfortable.

00:52:03.790 --> 00:52:05.125
It looks like I was right.

00:52:10.339 --> 00:52:11.757
You look very surprised.

00:52:12.549 --> 00:52:13.592
I see.

00:52:15.844 --> 00:52:18.305
- You came to me on purpose?
- Yes.

00:52:18.388 --> 00:52:20.891
I came here on purpose to buy you.

00:52:23.143 --> 00:52:25.270
We're getting divorced anyway.

00:52:25.354 --> 00:52:28.357
What's the point of being polite?
It does no good for me.

00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:29.858
How did you find out about me?

00:52:31.151 --> 00:52:32.152
What?

00:52:33.028 --> 00:52:34.571
Afraid Sujeong talked about you?

00:52:34.655 --> 00:52:36.281
How did you find out?

00:52:41.203 --> 00:52:42.329
Remember Jung Jihun?

00:52:43.288 --> 00:52:44.456
Sujeong's friend?

00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:47.125
He's always been a nuisance.

00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:50.420
He's foolish and doesn't have
a filter when he talks.

00:52:52.548 --> 00:52:55.843
He once got drunk in front of me
and started talking about you.

00:52:57.845 --> 00:52:58.887
You don't know him?

00:52:59.471 --> 00:53:00.639
Not really.

00:53:00.722 --> 00:53:02.099
It doesn't ring a bell.

00:53:06.687 --> 00:53:07.688
Really?

00:53:08.522 --> 00:53:09.523
Then,

00:53:10.566 --> 00:53:13.193
that's all the more reason to take this.

00:53:13.819 --> 00:53:14.862
Here.

00:53:16.154 --> 00:53:17.155
Good work.

00:53:18.198 --> 00:53:19.199
Enjoy it.

00:53:20.075 --> 00:53:22.035
Buy yourself something nice.

OKAY, GOOD NIGHT

ARE YOU OKAY?

00:54:41.907 --> 00:54:43.325
I didn't think it would rip.

00:54:43.992 --> 00:54:45.452
I guess you didn't put in much.

00:54:47.496 --> 00:54:48.580
Thank you for the gift.

00:54:56.129 --> 00:54:58.966
I can't believe there's someone
who would turn down cash.

00:55:00.217 --> 00:55:03.053
It was probably worth
as much as your monthly salary.

00:55:03.637 --> 00:55:06.557
Says the guy who sought me out
just to save 10 million won.

00:55:07.599 --> 00:55:11.478
Geez, how am I supposed buy a lawyer
if you make me feel so self-conscious?

00:55:12.896 --> 00:55:13.939
I paid

00:55:14.857 --> 00:55:17.317
with my money to buy you.

00:55:17.985 --> 00:55:19.027
Don't forget that.

00:55:19.111 --> 00:55:22.155
If it weren't for that,
I wouldn't bother with trash like you.

00:55:23.365 --> 00:55:26.410
Since that's over, just quietly get lost.
