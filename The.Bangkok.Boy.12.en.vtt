00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.000
(Previously)
He and his father ordered the hit on our dad.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.140
I

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.900
am Songphoom's son!

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.500
The son of the man you ordered to kill!

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.900
What the heck are you doing, Sun?
You're making a lot of noise.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.140
Let's go.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.020
Quick!

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.660
I told you, someone like him

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.850
wouldn't dare to shoot.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:18.940
Jun-ho.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.180
Stupid but loyal.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.540
Let's go to Songmin's mom's house.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.620
"The Bangkok Boy"
(Episode 12)

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.900
Peace.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.140
Peace.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:39.660
Peace!

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.340
Who the heck are you?

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.460
Who the heck are you?

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:47.900
Why did you capture me?

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.020
Peace!

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.500
Peace!

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.260
Nap.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.780
Why did you capture me?

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.820
I asked you, why?

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:12.980
Why are you doing this?

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.660
Why did you take me?

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:16.860
You betrayed us, didn't you?

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.180
Why are you doing this?

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.780
Why?

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.020
You betrayed us, didn't you, you jerk?

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.820
Why the heck would you do this?

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.340
Why did you take me?

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.660
It's almost over, Mei.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.660
Don't get yourself hurt anymore.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:44.820
Darn it!

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.060
You betrayed us, didn't you?

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.540
Why are you doing this?

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.340
Why are you doing this, Nap?

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.260
Darn you!

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.260
What do you want from us?

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.500
Why are you doing this? Let me go!

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:56.580
Let go!

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.660
Why are you doing this? Let me go!

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:59.780
Let go!

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:00.980
Let me go!

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.100
Mei.

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.140
Peace.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.860
Jung.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:38.380
Jung.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.700
Jung! Jung!

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:40.740
Jung!

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:41.820
Jung!

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.140
Cherry.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:46.460
Crap.

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.600
My head hurts like hell.

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:52.820
Are you okay?

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:56.820
Darn it.

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.620
What the heck just happened?

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.020
I don't know.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:02.380
No.

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.020
Hey, are you alright?

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.460
Jung, go to the hospital!

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:06.780
Don't you die on me now.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.220
Get up! Get up!

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:11.500
Are you okay?

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:13.580
Jung.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.540
Come on, let's go to the hospital.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.100
Darn it, is anyone following?

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:36.420
Don't think so, bro.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:38.740
Sun.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:40.100
Where did you go?

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:46.500
We'll talk later.

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:51.340
What happened to you guys?

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.260
How the heck am I
supposed to end this?

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:59.260
What now?

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:03.220
Well...

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.300
Do whatever it takes

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.700
to get him to reveal
where he hid the assets

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.220
and the important documents
from our foster father.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.140
That's Sun's sister.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:14.700
So what?

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.300
Hold her hostage.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.780
If her brother goes crazy,

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.260
we'll have leverage.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:24.460
But...

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.660
Did you leave any trace behind?

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.140
No.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:34.100
Good.

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:53.260
Nurse! Please help my friend!

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:55.340
Jung, are you okay?

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:56.460
Sit down first.

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:58.420
I'm in pain, darn it.

00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:59.660
You, stay here.

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.100
Nurse, please take care of my friend.

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:02.020
Wait.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:05.300
- Miss, what happened to the patient?
- Darn, she just left me here.

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:08.980
- Please help!
- Calm down, put your leg up.

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:18.580
Sun, we're screwed!

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.060
What? What happened?

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:22.860
Sun, why was your phone off?

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:24.700
What's going on?

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:26.540
Peace and Mei are missing!

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:27.580
What?

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.380
Yeah, Peace and Mei got kidnapped.

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:31.660
How?

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:35.620
We were just sitting at home,
and next thing we knew, we were drugged.

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:40.340
I didn't even know when I passed out.
When I woke up, they were already gone.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.340
Darn it. Who did this?

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:44.740
If it wasn't the lobbyist,
then it must be Joe's men.

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:46.980
What should we do now?

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:50.860
Tian, is my phone working yet?

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:52.540
It's been working for a while now.

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:56.580
And how's the thing
I asked you to handle?

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:59.620
That's been done for ages. I wanted
to show you, but you were never free.

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:00.900
Show me now.

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.260
Gather all the data and send it to me.

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:15.620
Got it.

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:20.020
Hey bro, do you know this place?

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:23.620
Why?

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:26.020
I think I know where
Peace and Mei are being held

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:27.620
and who took them.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:47.860
Just tell us

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:49.820
so this can end.

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:52.220
You'll be free from this pain.

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:04.020
You're not gonna talk?

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:30.700
What is this?

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:38.020
What is this?

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:40.860
Huh? What is this?

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:52.900
Let me see.

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:15.180
Who is this?

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:23.060
I asked you, who is this?

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:24.860
Huh?

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:56.820
Who is this woman?

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:17.260
Jun-ho.

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:21.740
Stay here. I'll be back.

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:31.980
Phew, I thought no one
was going to show up.

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:36.100
Take good care of our guest.

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:01.180
About the real estate
you asked me to check,

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:03.860
everything Joe has been
buying up belonged to Madam Yao.

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.900
After Madam Yao died,
they were sold dirt cheap.

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:11.180
It's suspicious how Joe knew

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:13.540
where she hid all her assets.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.950
The GPS location where
Peace's signal went dead

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:18.180
is Madam Yao's old
drug manufacturing building.

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:20.660
Joe just bought it.
We know the building,

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:22.260
but we don't know which floor.

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:24.260
There are at least ten floors.

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:26.260
They probably took Peace

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:30.060
to force him to reveal where the hidden assets
and weapons trade documents are.

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:32.340
He must have guarded all over the place.

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:36.740
Too bad I can't hack into
the surveillance from here.

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:41.180
I'll have to tap into the old comm box for that
building, maybe sneak into the security system.

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:44.220
You guys stall for me.

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:46.300
If you find Peace and Mei first,
that's even better.

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:03.220
Traitor.

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:10.540
And is what you did supposed to be loyalty?

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:13.920
If you had acted like a true heir,

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:16.900
Jihoon wouldn't have
been able to do anything.

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:22.380
Our foster father
wouldn't have ended up like this.

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:23.860
Hey.

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:26.300
These shady businesses

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:29.660
are better suited to a scum like you.

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:34.380
No, wait.

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:37.880
Maybe it's just Jihoon alone.

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:41.340
You're just Jihoon's lackey, aren't you?

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:42.300
Or am I wrong?

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.560
Can't think for yourself, you idiot.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:48.620
Darn you, Joe Sungmin.

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:49.460
What's wrong, Joe Jun-ho?

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:52.180
Oh?

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:54.860
What's your real last name anyway?

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:03.300
Sun is coming.

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:13.420
Sun's on his way to rescue you.

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:18.890
Stay here and keep watching.

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.660
Sun is coming to save us.

00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:02.500
Bro, I'll leave this to you.
I'm going to help Peace and Mei.

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:05.420
Hey!

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:06.860
Kill him.

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:04.820
Tian, the plan's not working anymore.

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:12.460
Where are Peace and Mei?

00:17:12.850 --> 00:17:14.020
Can't believe this.

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:19.340
You risked your life to save
the guy who killed your father?

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:23.660
It's because of you and your father
that Peace is in this mess!

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:31.770
So that means I killed
that gay guy because of you?

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:40.220
Where are Peace and Mei?

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:32.340
Sun! I've hacked
into the surveillance system!

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:34.060
Can you help me find them?

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:36.580
There are hundreds of cameras!
Give me a sec!

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:56.260
Sun! I found them!
I found Peace and Mei!

00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:59.860
But Mei is being taken out of the room
by someone I don't recognize.

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:02.380
I'll try to find out
which room they're going to.

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:04.440
I'll send everyone
Peace's current location first.

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:25.820
Hello, Mrs. Joe.

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:18.860
Everyone! Cherry is in danger!

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:20.020
Can someone go help her?

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:26.020
Crap, I can't go.

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:30.060
Looks like I'm closest to
Cherry's location. I'll go help her.

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:39.940
Hey! You jerk!

00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:16.510
Tian.

00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:20.070
Tian!

00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:22.040
Cherry.

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:29.750
Tian.

00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:45.220
Cherry, take him to the hospital.

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:49.740
I'll help Sun with the rest.

00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:10.250
So pathetic, jerk.

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:43.700
Mei.

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:44.940
Tan!

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:45.820
Tan!

00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:47.020
Bro!

00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:48.220
Mei.

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:51.460
Hey guys, I found Mei.
I'll go help her first.

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:14.700
Hello, Godfather.

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:20.580
You've recovered?

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:22.860
That's just like you.

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:26.940
I'm not even a bit surprised.

00:28:29.530 --> 00:28:34.260
Like I said, if a cheap trick
like that could kill me,

00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:37.420
I'd be dead
a thousand times already.

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:39.780
But thanks anyway.

00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:43.220
I was looking for a way to retreat.

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:11.720
So this was a setup?

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:26.000
Who gave you permission
to see me on your own?

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:29.420
I have an offer for you

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:32.140
that I think you'll
definitely be interested in.

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:33.820
But if you're not willing to listen,

00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:36.000
I'll just apologize and walk away.

00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:38.660
You've got guts.

00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:41.700
Then let me tell you what I want first.

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:44.660
Go on.

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:50.460
Since Madam Yao is dead,
you must not kill me.

00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:55.200
And what makes you think I would?

00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:59.630
Because if I were you,
I definitely would.

00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:04.100
What do you have to trade?

00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:11.460
You might want to
check your medicine.

00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:16.900
The one you're taking every day.
Make sure it's really medicine.

00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:19.460
As for who did it,

00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:23.940
I'll tell you once I know I'm safe.

00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:27.740
Then I'll keep you alive for now.

00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:33.700
And anything that belonged to
Madam Yao that you're still hiding,

00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:37.500
bring it all to me.

00:31:00.290 --> 00:31:02.450
Looks like we really
need to regroup in Korea.

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:09.940
Songmin or Jihoon.

00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:13.660
One of those two is betraying me.

00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:24.660
What a jerk, Joe.

00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:41.050
Goodbye, son.

00:33:08.610 --> 00:33:09.530
Shoot him.

00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:41.820
Wanna get revenge, Jun-ho?

00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:45.060
Drive.

00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:46.740
Your lack of discipline

00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:50.160
forced us to move our plan up
from next month to today.

00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:57.140
I want you to
dismantle this orphanage.

00:33:57.420 --> 00:34:00.420
Leave only you and a couple
of strong men to stay in Thailand.

00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:02.500
What is Mr. Joe planning?

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:04.100
Lobbyist.

00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:12.020
This is a gift for you.
Use it as you see fit.

00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:20.380
Get in the car.

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:28.180
What is it?

00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:31.060
Were you planning
to confess your love?

00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:34.860
I think someday,

00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:39.660
one of us will have to kill the other.

00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:45.140
That went from love confession
to death threat real fast.

00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:48.060
You're very straightforward.

00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:52.340
Well, when people
like us are that direct,

00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:54.340
what do you think the reason is?

00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:57.940
It's probably because

00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:03.540
we're confident the other person
won't reject us, right?

00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:08.170
Once Yao is dead,
Godfather is going to kill you.

00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:11.500
That's not surprising to me.

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:14.080
I mean kill you right away.

00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:18.140
That's a bit extreme, isn't it?

00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:22.820
Have you figured
a way out for yourself?

00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:26.860
What about you?
Got any suggestions for me?

00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:34.980
I want you to switch
Mr. Joe's pills with flour pills.

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:37.700
Then stop giving them to him for a while.

00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:40.090
You can go run to him
and tell him right after.

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:44.340
Oh, but don't say it's me yet.

00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:47.530
Wait until he
guarantees your life first.

00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:52.260
Aren't you afraid
I might expose you?

00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:58.100
When I do business with someone,

00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:00.660
I study them well.

00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:03.860
To rise to the top,

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:07.180
we have to knock
those above us down first.

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:09.900
So you need to choose.

00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:12.620
Who do you want
your final enemy to be?

00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:16.420
Mr. Joe or me?

00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:19.020
This is a golden opportunity.

00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:22.660
Mr. Joe isn't
that invincible in Thailand.

00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:25.620
Why are you

00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:28.180
so confident that
everything will go your way?

00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:33.140
Because Godfather
is planning to retreat to Korea.

00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:37.060
He's probably using
his illness as an excuse to escape.

00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:49.060
So, you're planning to shoot
both the husband and the wife?

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:50.660
Wife?

00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:54.210
Madam Joe?

00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:55.970
I didn't do it.

00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:57.680
Her husband did.

00:36:58.580 --> 00:37:00.140
Killed her with his own hands.

00:37:01.390 --> 00:37:04.040
So, did you get
what you were looking for?

00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:08.020
It's done. It's with him.

00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:12.530
You were right
from the beginning. It was here.

00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:14.320
But it was pointless.

00:37:15.730 --> 00:37:18.850
Only he knew all the codes.

00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:21.390
That old jerk never trusted anyone.

00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:34.400
The lobbyist is here.

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:03.180
Mei's been taken.

00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:06.920
It's okay. Tan found Mei.
We'll meet up outside.

00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:12.430
Sun, I'm sorry.

00:38:13.010 --> 00:38:14.270
Can we not talk about this right now?

00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:28.620
Let's go.

00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:09.060
Hello.

00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:10.380
Aim.

00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:15.180
You think you're
the only one with a gun, huh?

00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:17.300
You little lobbyist brat.

00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:27.140
Don't be confused. No need.

00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:30.060
Just remember this.

00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:34.370
Today, you

00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:38.260
are going to kill Mr. Joe.

00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:41.570
You understand me?

00:39:57.220 --> 00:39:58.260
So satisfying.

00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:02.140
That jerk Joe is dead.

00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:04.460
That jerk Yao is dead.

00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:06.940
That Songphoom idiot is dead too.

00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:08.220
You know who killed them?

00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:10.180
Me. It was me.

00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:12.380
I killed all of them.

00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:21.860
And next will be
you darn lobbyist scum.

00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:25.460
I'll take you down one by one.

00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:27.300
Just wait, you jerk.

00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:31.060
But you can't die just yet.
You still have to do your job for me.

00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:36.580
Now it's your turn.

00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:40.100
Go pretty up Mr. Joe's corpse first.

00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:45.930
Darn it! Out of bullets.

00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:48.660
Oh right. You're already dead.

00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:55.940
Do you know what's happening
right now? Do you?

00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:01.540
This is my era.

00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:04.660
Mine. Right now.

00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:07.660
Hey, be happy for me! Hey! Hey!

00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:10.020
Hey! Darn it, cheer for me!

00:41:11.490 --> 00:41:12.740
Yeah, that's more like it.

00:41:15.970 --> 00:41:16.940
Very good. Very good.

00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:23.470
Take good care of my gun.

00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:28.940
Hold it tight.

00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:47.790
Yes, teacher.
It's exactly what I suspected.

00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:51.140
The lobbyists killed Godfather.

00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:53.220
I didn't make it in time to save him.

00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:04.420
You okay?

00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:13.140
Stop.

00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:27.420
Mei.

00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:31.460
Who are you? Where's Tan?

00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:42.020
The guy who fought me,
was his name Tan?

00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:44.900
He's strong.

00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:48.860
But not stronger than me.

00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:52.140
Don't worry. He's not dead.

00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:56.380
Give me Jun-ho
and let's stop fighting.

00:44:57.260 --> 00:45:00.260
We'll be seeing
each other again soon.

00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:05.500
For now, let's get
our people to the hospital.

00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:15.700
Yes, teacher.

00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:19.060
Oh, right, yes,
Godfather collapsed.

00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:21.140
The doctor said it's critical.

00:45:22.210 --> 00:45:24.640
You switched Mr. Joe's medicine,
didn't you?

00:45:26.450 --> 00:45:28.400
You think I did it?

00:45:31.210 --> 00:45:33.620
Before you decide to kill me,

00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:35.790
there's something
I want to tell you.

00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:39.860
One of the Bangkok Boys is a lobbyist.

00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:45.380
Why do you think
Songmin got so close to them?

00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:49.310
Whether it's you or Songmin,
someone will pay.

00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:01.380
Songmin. That traitor.

00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:32.060
Why are you here?

00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:35.020
Mr. Joe was killed by the lobbyists.

00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:45.220
Jihoon sent me to get you.
We're regrouping in Korea.

00:46:47.450 --> 00:46:48.790
Lobbyists.

00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:56.100
I'll kill them all.

00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:29.380
(Police)

00:48:43.450 --> 00:48:46.180
Tim, sit down.

00:48:46.890 --> 00:48:49.280
Darn, I've never
been to jail like you, jerk.

00:48:49.290 --> 00:48:50.700
What the heck?

00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:52.700
Sit.

00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:59.540
What about Tan and Tian?

00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:01.740
What's gonna happen now, Sun?

00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:05.620
I've never been to jail before, darn it!

00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:08.500
I think you better calm down.

00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:16.730
Sun, doesn't this
all feel kinda familiar?

00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:20.060
Darn, it's been four years.

00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:24.460
And everything still
looks the same, darn it.

00:49:25.150 --> 00:49:26.550
Never thought to improve anything?

00:49:28.110 --> 00:49:30.410
But I feel like this time,
it's not going to end the same.

00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:34.020
Who's Akkira Leepongpan?

00:49:35.850 --> 00:49:36.720
Stand up.

00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:57.620
Alone?

00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:05.620
What about me?

00:50:05.660 --> 00:50:06.580
Sun.

00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:08.660
Sun!

00:50:13.950 --> 00:50:14.800
Uncle.

00:50:30.730 --> 00:50:31.660
Sit down.

00:50:34.770 --> 00:50:35.980
How are you, Sun?

00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:41.100
Uncle, did you find Mei and Peace?

00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:43.140
Don't worry.

00:50:43.750 --> 00:50:46.740
Mei, Peace, and Cherry
have been confirmed as victims.

00:50:47.580 --> 00:50:49.010
By the way, how are you doing?

00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:52.490
And what about Jinny?

00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:58.020
Jinny is just outside the room.
I didn't let her come in. Don't worry.

00:51:03.580 --> 00:51:04.740
Thank you very much, Uncle.

00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:07.100
I've caused you trouble again.

00:51:08.070 --> 00:51:09.180
What are you going to do next?

00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:13.820
I guess I have to
just let it run its course.

00:51:16.170 --> 00:51:17.430
But I'm sorry

00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:20.880
for dragging my comrades
into trouble again.

00:51:23.310 --> 00:51:24.210
What's wrong, Uncle?

00:51:25.890 --> 00:51:29.260
If you had enough power
to grant your comrades freedom,

00:51:30.070 --> 00:51:31.450
what would you be
willing to trade for it?

00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:35.510
What do you mean?
I don't understand.

00:51:36.900 --> 00:51:38.860
Have you ever seen this tattoo?

00:51:41.260 --> 00:51:45.300
Before 1957, back then
government officials were limited,

00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:47.780
especially enforcement officers

00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:51.580
like the police, district chiefs,
and deputy district chiefs.

00:51:52.210 --> 00:51:54.220
That gave rise to a group of people

00:51:54.780 --> 00:51:58.260
who were hired by the government
to suppress gangs and brothels

00:51:58.740 --> 00:52:00.830
and deal with them
in a specialized way.

00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:06.180
In Bangkok at that time, they were
called the "Nine-Gangsters".

00:52:06.860 --> 00:52:08.660
These people
never really disappeared.

00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:10.870
They just hid behind the scenes

00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:14.200
and stepped in to handle
certain matters when necessary.

00:52:16.170 --> 00:52:17.440
Uncle, you're saying...

00:52:18.220 --> 00:52:20.390
There are both good
and bad people in society.

00:52:21.140 --> 00:52:25.730
Our job is to keep the bad people
bad enough to be controlled.

00:52:27.090 --> 00:52:28.080
Lobbyists.

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.660
Alright, what information
do you want to give?

00:52:35.370 --> 00:52:36.850
My condition is

00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:42.380
that everything from today and the past

00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:45.920
must be cleared of any wrongdoing
for my comrades.

00:52:48.630 --> 00:52:49.790
Want to play some chess?

00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:08.060
From what I've assessed, it seems
you don't have any bargaining power now.

00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:12.850
But my information will
wipe the board clean for you.

00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:16.870
If that information
involves drug trafficking

00:53:17.690 --> 00:53:19.840
or the staged death of Yao,

00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:23.220
or Mr. Joe ordering your father's murder...

00:53:24.310 --> 00:53:25.420
Or the Koreans

00:53:26.690 --> 00:53:30.140
who came to settle and
do something in Bangkok.

00:53:31.700 --> 00:53:33.020
I have all that information.

00:53:35.090 --> 00:53:35.940
Surveillance footage,

00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:40.640
portraits of illegal
Korean immigrants,

00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:42.760
all through Joe's network.

00:53:46.530 --> 00:53:47.540
Useless.

00:53:48.190 --> 00:53:51.180
Joe Jun Sa, the former
Korean special agent,

00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:54.860
used his connections
and spy network

00:53:56.020 --> 00:53:58.210
to turn himself into
a black market trader.

00:53:59.170 --> 00:54:00.810
He deals everything,

00:54:01.130 --> 00:54:04.640
from drugs, weapons, to plutonium.

00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:07.580
Eventually, he sent massive funds

00:54:08.010 --> 00:54:10.950
to support operations
along his country's borders.

00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:15.320
In another light,
he's a secret hero.

00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:20.110
And in our country,
it's suitable for it to be his base.

00:54:21.170 --> 00:54:26.580
But now Joe Jun Sa is dead,
as are Madame Yao and Songphoom.

00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:30.320
You and we have all
been dancing on his palm.

00:54:31.740 --> 00:54:33.580
The person we
never paid attention to

00:54:35.130 --> 00:54:36.040
is Joe Jihoon.

00:54:39.610 --> 00:54:40.810
Jihoon,

00:54:43.540 --> 00:54:45.900
the quiet, strange one.

00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:49.520
Why is that?

00:54:51.540 --> 00:54:52.940
He's collaborating with Aim,

00:54:53.730 --> 00:54:55.300
using the deaths of those people

00:54:56.490 --> 00:54:58.130
to shake our power.

00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:01.020
But wait a minute,

00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:03.860
Aim is already dead, right?

00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:06.550
What the heck is going on?
I'm totally confused.

00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:12.970
Looks like I have more
information to trade than you do.

00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:16.650
If I'm useless,

00:55:18.310 --> 00:55:19.180
you wouldn't have come.

00:55:22.340 --> 00:55:23.350
Tell me,

00:55:24.370 --> 00:55:25.360
what do you want from me?

00:55:26.100 --> 00:55:27.450
You're not that valuable.

00:55:28.060 --> 00:55:29.340
I just want to help you.

00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:31.420
Your comrades' freedom

00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:33.960
in exchange for you
becoming one of our soldiers.

00:55:34.820 --> 00:55:35.660
You choose.

00:55:37.660 --> 00:55:38.500
Sun,

00:55:39.310 --> 00:55:40.780
you're as skilled as your father.

00:55:42.230 --> 00:55:43.890
But don't be like your father.

00:55:59.940 --> 00:56:01.660
Darn it, Nap! Darn it!

00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:06.580
We all know everything now.

00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:13.060
That they took your sister hostage.

00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:16.380
Why the heck did you do that, huh?

00:56:16.700 --> 00:56:19.100
If there's something, just tell us.
Aren't we friends?

00:56:22.460 --> 00:56:24.220
This time, I'll forgive you.

00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:26.900
But if it happens again,

00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:29.740
don't call us friends anymore.

00:56:30.860 --> 00:56:33.500
By the way,
is Nap's sister cute?

00:56:33.810 --> 00:56:35.800
Darn it, darn it!

00:56:36.510 --> 00:56:37.940
If you've seen his face already,
then let's just go back.

00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:39.590
Let him rest.

00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:43.140
Wait until he recovers,
then we'll punch him once each.

00:56:46.380 --> 00:56:47.500
- Go, go.
- Go.

00:56:48.260 --> 00:56:50.680
Darn it, don't do that again.
Rest well.

00:57:07.890 --> 00:57:08.760
Don't be confused.

00:57:11.300 --> 00:57:12.740
I lied to the bro for you.

00:57:13.660 --> 00:57:14.740
Everyone understands.

00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:32.340
That's pretty heavy, huh?

00:57:43.580 --> 00:57:46.620
(One month later)

00:57:46.660 --> 00:57:47.980
Eat this or eat my fist, bro?

00:57:47.980 --> 00:57:50.100
Whoa, why are you so spicy today?

00:57:50.100 --> 00:57:52.630
- Of course, bro. You want some?
- Hey, calm down.

00:57:52.860 --> 00:57:55.820
Don't, don't, chill out, man.
Take it easy.

00:57:57.740 --> 00:57:58.700
I'll stab too, come on!

00:57:58.860 --> 00:58:01.660
- Getting intense, huh?
- I've got one too, bring it on.

00:58:02.460 --> 00:58:03.580
Didn't wait to order, huh?

00:58:05.410 --> 00:58:06.580
No one's waiting.

00:58:06.580 --> 00:58:07.550
Sitting real close, huh?

00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:09.460
Hey, how's Jack doing?

00:58:09.890 --> 00:58:11.860
He's getting better, bro. A few more days
and he'll be out of the hospital.

00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:14.020
We're family, after all.

00:58:15.140 --> 00:58:17.600
Just the four of us left.
We've gotta stick together.

00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:19.820
Right?

00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:24.540
Thanks.

00:58:27.380 --> 00:58:28.620
Alright, bring it on.

00:58:29.100 --> 00:58:31.780
Stick together, man.
Long live Bangkok boys!

00:58:32.940 --> 00:58:33.900
Cringe as hell.

00:58:34.140 --> 00:58:35.100
Seriously cringe.

00:58:35.100 --> 00:58:40.020
- Nah, it's not that bad. Cool name, cheers!
- Cheers, cheers!

00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:45.180
Swap it.

00:58:45.700 --> 00:58:46.660
Want some of this?

00:58:58.420 --> 00:58:59.900
Now that this chaos is over...

00:59:01.150 --> 00:59:02.530
Can we really call it over?

00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:06.920
I feel empty.

00:59:10.050 --> 00:59:12.100
Like I've been chasing
other people's games all along.

00:59:12.670 --> 00:59:15.540
Until I got in so deep, I had no choice
but to join the lobbyists.

00:59:17.090 --> 00:59:19.980
To trade for freedom, for me
and my friends, from all the charges,

00:59:20.970 --> 00:59:22.640
and from the blackmail evidence

00:59:23.020 --> 00:59:24.900
that both Joe and
the lobbyists set up.

00:59:28.140 --> 00:59:29.360
Same goes for Nap.

00:59:29.970 --> 00:59:33.060
He became a lobbyist to survive
and secretly protect Kawin.

00:59:34.110 --> 00:59:36.540
Then he was
tasked to infiltrate Mr. Joe

00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:38.070
in collaboration with Jihoon.

00:59:39.630 --> 00:59:41.400
Things are bound to get
even more dangerous from here.

00:59:42.570 --> 00:59:45.320
Jihoon and Aim
won't let this go easily,

00:59:46.930 --> 00:59:48.210
neither will the lobbyists.

00:59:50.580 --> 00:59:51.420
As for Peace,

00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:54.530
he must feel heartbroken
about both his parents.

01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:32.970
But at least he seems relieved.

01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:36.500
And he decided to go back
and study to follow his dream.

01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:39.820
But me?

01:00:41.190 --> 01:00:42.830
What should I do next

01:00:43.330 --> 01:00:45.860
to avoid being a pawn in
someone else's power game again?

01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:48.340
Right.

01:00:49.140 --> 01:00:50.660
I need to become a player,

01:00:52.130 --> 01:00:53.980
so I won't lose
anyone else ever again.

01:01:01.780 --> 01:01:07.420
(Two months later)

01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:10.190
Take care of yourself.

01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:14.620
Even if we don't think Jihoon
will chase you all the way there.

01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:18.080
Okay.

01:01:18.990 --> 01:01:19.860
Finish school fast

01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:21.900
and come back soon.

01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:25.500
I'll be waiting.

01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:27.860
Bye.

01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:53.620
It's been a while, huh?

01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:58.220
(Mr. Kongphon Thiwapanya)

01:01:58.220 --> 01:01:59.540
I'm sorry

01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:02.220
for not going to your funeral.

01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:07.900
Since you passed away,

01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:11.300
so much has happened.

01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:13.340
No.

01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:14.500
(Mr. Kongphon Thiwapanya)

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:17.970
If I hadn't pulled that knife that day,

01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:24.100
none of this would've happened.

01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:30.900
Kong.

01:02:32.380 --> 01:02:33.580
You know what?

01:02:35.780 --> 01:02:37.780
Every time I feel happy,

01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:43.460
I feel even more guilty toward you.

01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:45.980
(Mr. Kongphon Thiwapanya)

01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:47.260
I don't know

01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:52.500
if I even deserve to be happy.

01:02:54.740 --> 01:02:56.120
Because when I think of you,

01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:01.100
it hurts even more.

01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:03.900
(Mr. Kongphon Thiwapanya)

01:03:06.940 --> 01:03:07.980
Maybe

01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:12.220
this sounds selfish,

01:03:15.180 --> 01:03:19.900
but now, I'm free from that knife.

01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:24.060
Now I know

01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:28.300
that the more I suffer

01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:32.810
and the longer I stay in pain,

01:03:34.830 --> 01:03:36.220
it would mean

01:03:41.290 --> 01:03:42.960
that everything you did

01:03:46.370 --> 01:03:47.860
would be for nothing, Kong.

From now on,

01:04:00.270 --> 01:04:01.980
I'll live my life to the fullest.

01:04:04.050 --> 01:04:05.460
Protect everyone I love

01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:10.690
and be as happy as I can

01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:15.560
for your sake too.
