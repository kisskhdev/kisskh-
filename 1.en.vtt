Hello

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.490
This radio wave... how...

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:12.000
The information is fine.
The donor committed suicide.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.590
Oh, why do you do this at such a young age?

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:15.759
That is to say

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.220
Where's the surgeon?

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:18.590
I am coming

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.300
Hello

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.180
What is the status?

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.180
Need to be removed now

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:24.930
What is the situation

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.140
Is this a tattoo?

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.190
-tatoo? -tatoo

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.320
- I think I've seen it somewhere.
- I also think I've seen it somewhere.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.320
I seem to have seen it in a history book.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.530

someone's longing donor.

How come this body is like a piece
of iron? It's really a waste of knife

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.840
It's not like he has super powers...

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.220
Scare me

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.509
What's wrong? What's
wrong? What are you doing?

It really doesn't hurt, right?

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:55.169
I've said it several times, it doesn't hurt

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.686
This is no way to defeat the original body.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.050
I was supposed to vomit and drool.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.970
Because a strange heart has
entered the body. This entry

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.180
Stand firm on your feet

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:05.760
You're abnormal.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.179
Isn't it a good thing to not feel any pain?

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.850
Yes.

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.140
No pain is a good thing.

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.429
But it may not be a good thing, so I...

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.100
So please let me leave the hospital.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.000
If it doesn't hurt, you'll have to act.

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.820
What's on your wrist? Do you have a tattoo?

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.660
No, I don't know if this is
a side effect of the surgery.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.490
Did you make some bad friends?

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:28.779
Where do my friends come from?

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.620
Don't lose your temper and eat slowly

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.580
Look, my heart rate is over 90.

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:33.710
Besides

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.380
Don't buy this stuff

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.940
- You have no money again.
- Why does your father have no money?

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.396
If you want to make something
or eat something, just ask.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:42.436
I have something I want to do

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:43.130
Even though

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:44.730
- I want to go back to Taekwondo. - No.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:45.680
Didn't you let me just say it?

00:04:45.681 --> 00:04:47.156
No, Taekwondo is definitely
not allowed. It's dangerous.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.866
The doctor clearly said that
I could exercise moderately.

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:50.099
What do doctors know?
Only your father and I know

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.156
Why should I get a heart
transplant if I can't even exercise?

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.809
If you really want to exercise,
you can go to college and do Pilates.

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.100
- Dad. - Your dad.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.666
My heart stops beating when I
think of you in the middle of a race

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.030
Sleeping can be scared to death

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.450
Your mother

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.240
Your mother also had a heart attack.

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.530
Your grandfather also
died of a heart attack.

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.540
If even my child is
like this, I, as a father,

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.080
It's better to just follow along.

Organs are not batteries.
This is the first time

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.110
This time it's the pancreas

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.620
Anyway, fortunately, my father
should be able to leave this time.

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:52.370
Anyway

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.700
I'll hand it all over.

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:58.460

Okay, be more moderate.

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.100
Reach out

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.440
- Dad. - No.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.926
- I haven't said it yet.
- Taekwondo is definitely not an option

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:31.070
No, I'm not saying this.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.800
Did you exercise in PE class? I
can see your heart rate is rising.

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.080
Knee Kick

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.426
- I didn't exercise.
- Then why did your heart rate increase?

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:38.580
What is

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:42.040
I really am. If you do this
again, I will throw this away.

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:47.340
I'm going to be a designated driver today

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:48.840
You go back first

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.970
Buy a new pair of shoes on the way back

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.946
If you have money, buy some
healthy food with your friends.

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:56.390
Okay, that's all for today.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.020
I don't have any friends

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:00.310
Taekwondo, thank you for your hard work

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:02.060
You are late today, so I will punish you.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.730

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:08.150
Why do I owe 100,000 won in monthly rent?

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:09.820
I was just about to explain it to you.

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:11.660
Oh, look at this kid.

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:15.740
Boy, are you kicking like that
to pick a fight or to make friends?

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:16.806
Sister, when I was your age

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:19.580
You can do a 540 turn now. Let's go.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.000
I said this for your own good.

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:24.840
Keep your center of gravity

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:27.000
Stare at your target

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.470
Zhong Bi, you did this.

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:34.680
What happened?

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:39.470

Thank you for your hard work

When my father was still alive

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:36.150
I said all kinds of good and bad things.

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:37.280
Ouch

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:39.530
I can hear all of this, my God.

00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:57.150
Is this possible just because
I received a pancreas donation?

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.260
Then I'll accept it once.

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:00.930
So I think

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.680
Anyway, this

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:08.100
Maybe the donor has a special physique.

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:10.100
How do donors

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:12.690

You can only wear it,
absolutely not practice Taekwondo

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:41.970
Don't run. Walk slowly.

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:43.640
Okay, I'll go slowly.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:19.420
The uncle has been hanging around the
entrance of our gymnasium since just now.

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:22.420
Is he an exhibitionist,
a stalker, or a kidnapper?

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:24.220
All three are crimes

The heart is really strong.

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:36.286
I think I need to go to the doctor
to get a diagnosis certificate.

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:39.650
Such a big guy was gently grabbed
by a female junior high school student

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:41.189
Why does a female junior high
school student have such a tone?

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:43.780
Because my grandfather raised
me when I was learning to speak

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:46.320
You don't know the
extent of your ability yet.

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:49.530
I thought my growth
disk was opened too fast.

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:51.056
Who would have thought
this was a super power?

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:53.040
- Does your mother know?
- I don't have a mother.

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:55.250
Do you have a dad?

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:57.290
Dad has

00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:59.646
If he knew this, he would probably
cry for three days and two nights.

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:02.670
Then he made a scene, so I
absolutely couldn't tell him

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:03.960
well done

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:07.050
Super powers are
supposed to be kept secret.

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:09.300
So what secret superpower do you have?

00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:38.460
But who is the donor who has such ability?

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:40.396
Did you know that a person
can donate six organs?

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:41.090
Have no idea

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:44.300
Heart Lungs Cornea Kidneys Liver Pancreas

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:46.566
It means there are four other
people besides the two of us.

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:49.156
If we find the other four transplant
recipients, we'll probably have some clues.

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:50.140
How to find it?

00:13:50.141 --> 00:13:54.430
-= "The 17th Share Hope Transplant Sports Meet" was held at
Shengwangli=- The 17th Sharing Life Transplant Sports Conference

00:13:54.431 --> 00:13:56.430
Held today in Seoul

00:13:56.770 --> 00:14:00.400
The National Transplant Sports
Conference is held every two years

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:03.650
Prospective transplant
recipients and their families

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:05.940
A total of about 100 people participated

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:08.359
Huang Zaiyuan, President
of the Transplant Association

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:10.370
Before the competition officially begins

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:20.960
Jump Jump

00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:47.490

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:14.760
-=The 17th Sharing Hope Transplant Games=-

00:15:14.761 --> 00:15:18.840
Run well, this is the track

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:40.380
Nike

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.310
I just need shoes.

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:47.670
Have you looked carefully?

00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:50.270
No No

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:51.740
Hey, take it away.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:54.449
Look for it carefully.

00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:56.410
Why do you look at your phone every day?

00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.520
Uncle, you don't have any friends, right?

00:15:58.850 --> 00:15:59.969
Why do we need friends?

00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:01.690
Try this

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:05.329
No, this is a free tasting.

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:07.919
I'm very healthy after my kidney transplant

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:10.240
I give it to you because I am so grateful.

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:12.520
Good for the stomach

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.420
Thanks

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:16.010
What is there?

00:16:16.011 --> 00:16:17.999
If you have a bad stomach

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.909
It contains prebiotics and probiotics

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:22.820
Can clean the stomach

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:24.869
-Vitamins and vegetables -Auntie

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:25.870
Look at your arms.

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.240
Arm?

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:32.060
The other arm

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:34.300
What happened to your arm?

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:37.139
- No apple flavor? - Yes.

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:39.999
But if you eat too much of
this, your stomach will hurt.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.379
Ah, we still have food and salad.

00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:44.369
Salads are 5% cheaper
if delivered regularly

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:47.250
Let me show you what's going on.

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:52.230
I ran fast after my heart transplant

00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:55.140
Like this, my strength has also increased.

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:57.800
This man received a lung transplant.

00:16:58.440 --> 00:16:59.440
Show it

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:06.560
-=Dried fish darts event. Hit the darts and get free
draft beer! Hit the target every time from 7pm to 10pm =-

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:15.839
What's going on?

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.200
Feed Dried fish

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:21.640
What is that?

00:17:21.641 --> 00:17:23.730
Auntie, what are you capable of?

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:25.089
Me

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:27.650
No

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:30.699
Did you experience any
changes after the surgery?

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:32.569
Although I can't see

00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:34.629
But everyone says my skin has improved.

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:36.320
Become beautiful

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.490
Oh, how am I beautiful?

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:43.250
Is it a superpower to become beautiful?

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:46.309
-Being beautiful is a superpower
nowadays -It's not to that extent

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:47.570
No

00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:49.659
Recently many people pretend to buy Yakult

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:51.500
You always ask me for my number?

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:53.586
They all say they think of their first love
I said no.

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:54.660
Please use slowly

00:17:57.730 --> 00:17:59.580
Auntie, don't you have a tattoo?

00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:01.060
If you have a tattoo

00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:04.049
It must be a superpower. It
seems you haven't discovered it yet.

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:06.879
This uncle is a superpower
who knows everything.

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.980
When people with special
abilities gather together

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:11.270
There will also be unknown abilities

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:13.529
You'll know when you find the rest.

00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:15.060
How to find the rest

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:28.179
Park Wan-seo Heart Transplant

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:30.269

Taekwondo Primary School

00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:34.879
Five consecutive championships

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.229
My future dream is to marry Do Kyung-soo

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:38.639
Is Do Kyungsoo a member of BTS?

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:39.780
It's EXO

Kim Sun-nyeo Kidney Transplant

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:45.140
If you were born in 1975, you
are a rabbit and you are unmarried.

00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:48.300
First love is still written on her face

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:54.300
Park Ji-sung lung transplant

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:58.100
- Occupation - Stop talking

00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:00.479
Who are you

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:04.449
I am Huang Qidong, the
one who started it all

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:05.860
I had a corneal transplant.

00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:14.170
How did you find us?

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:19.019
Don't we all have a tattoo?

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:24.510
If this is within a few
kilometers radius, it will glow.

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:29.130
But since I'm the only one who
can see it, I can't explain it

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:31.219
So what the uncle did just now was

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:34.160
Control electromagnetic waves,
WIFI or something like that?

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:36.070
This

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:40.190
Here it comes

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:43.369
Another 500cc cup, please

00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:44.370
good

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:49.519
It's amazing

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.569
You can be our superpower captain.

00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:53.530
- Captain is shit - As
captain, find someone else

00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:55.170
It's not a military regime.

00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:59.309
Doesn't it mean that you have to
be within a few meters to see it?

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:00.439
Who knows where they are?

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:02.279
Then let's do the same
hacking attack as before.

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:03.459
- Hacking is bullshit. - Not in the movies.

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:04.660
Is it a dictatorship?

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:07.859
If you are caught spying on civilians

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:10.389
Will violate the Privacy Protection Act
and the Information and Communications Act

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:12.389
Personal information
leakage and reputation damage

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:14.219
It seems you don't know this.

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:17.179
Didn't you say you wanted to find it first?

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:19.249
I mean this method is unfair.

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:20.810
You think it's troublesome?
I'm too busy

00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:22.640
You don't have a job?

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:27.869
- Who said that? - What do you do?

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:29.679
I'm a screenwriter. I write scripts.

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:30.700
What script to write

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:34.139
-Hero -Show me

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:35.619
Ends next week

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:37.290
You like heroic themes?

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:39.306
Then you know the community
in that circle, right?

00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:42.479
We have a lot of hero information there.

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.769
- So you like us? - Yes

00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:47.890
We are one of the people there. The
local distortion of facts is very serious.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.120
You are a leftist.

00:20:49.121 --> 00:20:53.189
I'm telling you, this is
the end of our conversation.

00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:55.359
You're almost saying this in plain
language. What year were you born?

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:56.599
-88 -I am 87

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:58.159
- I was born in early 1988.
- What month exactly?

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:00.829
- How fast is April?
- Is April still considered the beginning of the year?

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:03.399
- Isn't this a national regulation?
- What's the basis for it not being a national regulation?

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:04.849
What is the basis for the basis?

00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:07.689
Hey, what are you doing?
It's such a nice day.

00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:09.679
Reborn from a body

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:11.010
Live like a family.

00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:24.410
Uncle, didn't we agree to split the bill?

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:29.809
Oh, it's really not quiet

00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:32.300
What show will you show me this time?

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:36.710
Do I want these poor souls to work for me?

00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:40.900
If you complain about the high price now

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:42.960
I'll go find someone else.

00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:46.930
You know that the Republic of
Korea is full of evil, right?

00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:41.640
So many tricks

00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:44.330
All out

00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:50.469
Eternal Life and Eternal
Spring, the God of Sai is Coming

00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:52.959
Omniscience and Blessings God Returns

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:55.569
Congratulations on your
resurrection, Lord Saishen

00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:57.889
You, a busy man, are here.

00:22:57.890 --> 00:23:01.220
Because I want to save one more poor soul.

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:03.729
We must learn from Sai Shen.

00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:07.570
Why does it sound to me like
you're trying to steal my opportunity?

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:10.170
Did you get an ear
injury when you were a kid?

00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:12.479
You heard wrong

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:14.110
No No

00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:16.460
I can hear clearly.

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:23.989
How much money does my daughter want?

00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:25.610
If we hand over the consortium,

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:31.139
But she didn't want to hand
over the pharmaceutical company.

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:34.590
Because this is the
business her father founded.

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:37.300
A filial daughter, your daughter

00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:38.870
Bingchun

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.920
Our family has no filial sons or
daughters from generation to generation.

00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:44.770
Blood is greedy

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:49.189
Originally, each follower counted as 45.

00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:50.899
Then I'll give you 50

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:52.339
If you give me the Renaissance

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:55.690
Isn't it because of you
that my ears are injured?

00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:58.129
When performing stunts at Zhengshan Market

00:23:58.130 --> 00:24:00.479
- You dialed the wrong number.
- 550,000 won

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:03.809
So I beat you like a dog

00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:05.250
It's on my pants.

00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:10.359
- We sold a lot of drugs that day.
- Don't say it, brother.

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:12.939
The drug dealer's henchman,
the guy who shits in his pants

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:15.679
You really think you're a god.

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:18.689
Damn it, stop talking, you drug dealer

00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:21.679
Stop talking about poop. Damn it.

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:23.410
You guy

00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:41.510
There are 5 minutes left at noon.

00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:44.740
You have to be back to
your position 5 minutes ago

00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:47.280
To do exactly what you should do
-=Sai Shen Consortium=-

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:47.680
-=Sai Shen Consortium=-

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:50.149
Accurate time will keep us safe
-=Sai Shen Consortium=-

00:25:50.149 --> 00:25:50.150
-=Sai Shen Consortium=-

00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:51.340
Please wear a helmet
-=Sai Shen Consortium=-

00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:51.780
-=Sai Shen Consortium=-

00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:52.741
Three minutes left
-=Sai Shen Consortium=-

00:25:52.741 --> 00:25:53.600
Three minutes left

00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:57.130
Users cannot force time to work

00:25:57.570 --> 00:26:00.600
Don't you know this is a
violation of the Labor Standards Act?

00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:03.239
You know so much about the
law, why don't you become a judge?

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:04.739
Why do this here?

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:06.829
Please do not treat us differently
because we are contract employees.

00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:08.399
It's not the contractors'
problem, even the president

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:09.340
If the rest time is observed

00:26:09.341 --> 00:26:11.179
That's the law I know.

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:13.819
The one who doesn't
comply is this consortium.

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:15.539
In order to catch up with the date
of the revival meeting or something

00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:18.129
Working overtime every day and
not having enough safety equipment

00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:20.120
If something happens, will you save us?

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:21.819
That leader will save

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:23.769
In the hell college, the guy
who didn't even get redemption

00:26:23.770 --> 00:26:26.100
How dare you mention the god of race?

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:40.880
- What happened to him?
- He fell from above

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:43.839
No, I've said it many times.

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:45.680
Let you change that, really

00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:47.320
Answer the phone?

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:21.040
When will someone come?

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:53.760
-=You who put safety
first are superheroes=-

00:27:56.970 --> 00:27:58.260
I saw

00:27:58.630 --> 00:27:59.829
Why don't you believe what people say?

00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:01.389
It's not that I don't believe

00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:04.480
This is called cataract in medical terms.

00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:07.730
- Of course, dopamine is secreted when you are excited.
- No, no

00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:10.130
I'm not excited. I can see it clearly.

00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:13.590
Why do we have to eat meat
that we rarely eat before?

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:17.440
Huang Shenling suddenly grew white hair

00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:18.850
That tree too

00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:22.459
- At that time,

00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:26.219
Do people who donate organs
have special physical conditions?

00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:27.719
It may also be a special physique

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:30.430
People who receive organ transplants

00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:33.000
There should be more.

00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:10.960
One more time

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:29.260
Where does the pollen come from?

00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:31.290
That's it.

00:29:31.291 --> 00:29:34.170
Go ahead. It's already started.

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:41.640
Don't you go out to play on weekends?

00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:44.150
No friends?

00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:45.640
I have no friends

00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:47.090
Why

00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:49.220
Because of dad?

00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:52.270
No, although there is also this reason

00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:55.380
But I took a year off due to
illness, so I don't have any friends

00:29:56.930 --> 00:29:57.930
I understand

00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:00.880
When I was sick, I didn't

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:03.720
When I am not sick, I am afraid of
getting sick, so I have no friends.

00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:06.240
People with super powers are lonely.

00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:15.570
Do you know that?
Have no idea

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:17.360
Do you know what it is?
What is

00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:21.790
Bad Guy

00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:24.000
Among the same kind of superpowers

00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:26.469
And will attack other superpowered people

00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:27.090
Why

00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:28.776
Do you want to have all the
super powers for yourself?

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:31.429
That's why we have to
find the bad guys first.

00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:32.639
Before the power is taken away

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:33.220
We

00:30:33.221 --> 00:30:34.390
To us

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:38.479
People with super powers are meant to
be friends with people with super powers.

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:40.270
Don’t rich people hang
out with rich people?

00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:41.770
Uncle You try this

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:43.520
Why Give it a try

00:30:50.450 --> 00:30:51.530
Uncle

00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:53.579
If you get caught by a
bad guy, just tell me.

00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:55.660
I will rescue all the people in our team.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.330
Wanshu

00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:03.130
But

00:31:03.210 --> 00:31:05.340
How do you spot the bad guys?

00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:07.670
Just look and you will know

00:31:08.050 --> 00:31:09.220
You can tell at a glance

00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:13.550
This guy is a bad guy

00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:15.600
Just take care of yourself

00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:17.600
Eat two chicken wings at a time

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:18.810
Wanshu

00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:20.140
Zhixing

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:22.270
Oh my god, I found it. I found it.

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:23.939
I found out what my super power is.

00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:25.150
Take a look

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:26.520
Look at it.

00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:30.530
Boom boom boom boom

00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:44.210
I don't have super powers, do I?

00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:46.340
Why only my tattoo?

00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:48.840
Round like a knockoff owl

00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:52.550
Auntie, why do you want super powers?

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:54.350
If you have super powers

00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:55.890
It can save lives, right?

00:31:55.930 --> 00:31:56.930
Like a hero

00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:59.380
Having super powers doesn't
necessarily make you a hero.

00:31:59.770 --> 00:32:00.770
Why

00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:03.810
Experience

00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:05.100
Positivity

00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:06.570
Number of people saved

00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:07.979
Degree of self-sacrifice

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:09.740
These are all scored.

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:11.530
Not everyone can be a hero

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:14.780
I don't really like the score line style.

00:32:15.030 --> 00:32:16.700
Hey, is he coming or not?

00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:19.290
Can he find it with his
amazing hacking skills?

00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:21.310
Have no idea
Ask again when you come.

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:23.329
If you eat too much, you
will have a stomachache

00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:25.500
You said you would
come, but you came so late

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.250
Young

00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:28.630
You can also send a message

00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:34.389
-=OK=-

00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:39.010
-=Park Ji-sung: Okay, let's do this=-
-=Huang Qidong, save me=-

00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:43.206
I will return the money to you

00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:45.230
Is money an issue, you son of a bitch?

00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:47.310
How can you win 11
jackpots in one location?

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:48.190
Eleven times

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:50.206
This machine seems to be
broken. What do you want to do?

00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:51.070
Take off your glasses

00:32:51.071 --> 00:32:53.490
No, this doesn't seem to be bad.

00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:55.280
I will compensate

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:56.120
Nonsense

00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:59.450
I see you hit the jackpot with
just a flick of your finger, right?

00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:00.540
Are you Pikachu?

00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:01.330
Will it create static electricity?

00:33:01.331 --> 00:33:03.040
No, I'm not Pikachu.

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:06.080
It's a superpower

00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:10.090
Wow you are so funny

00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:12.760
I have to call your brother Long Jiu

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:15.220
Let me send a text message first.

00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:34.570
That one needs to be pushed.

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:37.489
I've already said that if you eat
too much, you'll get a stomachache.

00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:38.700
I ate five more

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:40.030
Where did you go?

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:42.676
Junior high school students
are not allowed to enter here

00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:43.766
This is not an internet cafe

00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:44.936
I was supposed to be in high school.

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:45.660
But I took a year off.

00:33:45.661 --> 00:33:48.016
No matter if you are a high school student
or something, this is not an Internet cafe

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:49.056
Auntie, I don't drink Yakult

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:50.080
stomachache

00:33:50.670 --> 00:33:52.669
I'm not here to sell Yakult

00:33:52.670 --> 00:33:54.379
I'm here to take him away.

00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:57.260
I've said he's not someone
you can just take away.

00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:59.139
This guy caused a scene in the store.

00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:01.196
I'm in debt and I've turned off my
phone. What do you think I should do?

00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:02.220
Hello

00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:03.970
No more paper

00:34:04.930 --> 00:34:05.930
there

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:15.320
Hanging

00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:18.909
Is it your friend?
No

00:34:19.449 --> 00:34:20.449
Uncle

00:34:20.739 --> 00:34:21.870
Let him go.

00:34:21.949 --> 00:34:23.409
My dad is a Taekwondo master

00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:25.425
My dad is a convict with
four prior convictions.

00:34:25.449 --> 00:34:27.369
You didn't hear me just now, did you?

00:34:27.370 --> 00:34:30.330
This uncle made a mess in the store.

00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:31.686
So this uncle suffered a heavy loss.

00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:33.606
The person who caused the accident
shall bear the compensation for the loss

00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:34.920
Not a friend

00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:37.170
He has no friends

00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:40.010
He needs to be taught a lesson.

00:34:40.139 --> 00:34:41.139
It's really useless

00:34:41.219 --> 00:34:42.219
no

00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:43.600
We're going to eat ribs.

00:34:43.679 --> 00:34:44.469
Wait till you finish your lesson.

00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:45.809
I feel like I've been reborn.

00:34:45.810 --> 00:34:46.600
Otherwise, leave

00:34:46.601 --> 00:34:47.681
I walk my own Yangguan Road

00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:50.310
Don't do this

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:52.520
Just let him go

00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:53.940
Ah, what?

00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:58.450
This is a gift for you.

00:34:58.530 --> 00:34:59.570
You guys

00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:00.756
You really ignored my words.

00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:02.740
They say I have a bad stomach.

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:23.390
Beef ribs or pork ribs

00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:31.670
I've been in there for ten minutes.

00:35:31.770 --> 00:35:33.310
Are all four of you here?

00:35:36.690 --> 00:35:38.650
It took exactly 4 minutes and 28 seconds

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:02.090
Go fast

00:36:08.890 --> 00:36:10.520
Call your dad.

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:12.850
Just called

00:36:30.910 --> 00:36:31.910
What is that?

00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:33.170
Exceed the past

00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:40.800
That guy

00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:12.790
what to do

00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:15.710
Power 5

00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:31.810
Get out of the way

00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:04.800
what to do

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:14.680
kick off

00:38:48.090 --> 00:38:50.050
This won't work. Stop it.

00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:54.640
I've said it before.

00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:56.930
It's my brother who sees you as pitiful.

00:38:57.350 --> 00:38:59.900
Take off your glasses, bastard.

00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:24.920
So dirty

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:38.230
Stop

00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:46.860
Four people

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:53.990
We are full.

00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:56.620
This buffet is quite delicious.

00:39:56.910 --> 00:39:58.266
Because someone has suffered so much

00:39:58.290 --> 00:40:01.330
In the end, they didn't
even settle the bill.

00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:03.646
If you don't know, you might
think it was you who paid the bill.

00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:04.879
Are you speaking plain language?

00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:05.750
This is like a honorific, right?

00:40:05.751 --> 00:40:08.049
Stop arguing, we are all
friends with super powers

00:40:08.050 --> 00:40:09.710
Friend is a ghost

00:40:09.970 --> 00:40:12.180
Do you still want to keep him with you?

00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:14.930
If you have the ability, then
hack in and find it yourself.

00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:18.180
Is it because I can't
do it that I don't do it?

00:40:18.270 --> 00:40:20.560
It's because it's against the law.

00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:21.560
Then you who abide by the law

00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:23.520
Why would you plagiarize
someone else's script?

00:40:24.810 --> 00:40:25.860
Did you doxx me?

00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:26.940
Yes

00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:28.939
Talking about justice all day long

00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:30.030
So I looked at

00:40:30.110 --> 00:40:31.490
What screenwriter

00:40:31.610 --> 00:40:33.780
A script that was sold
with great difficulty

00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:35.370
Stealing from friends?

00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:37.200
That's why I have no friends.

00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:54.340
This guy is a well-known
malicious commenter.

00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:56.510
How many times have you been sued?

00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:59.446
I'm not the kind of guy who gives bad
reviews without even watching a movie.

00:40:59.470 --> 00:41:00.640
This is a beggar boy.

00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:03.020
Did you know that your coin
has now dropped to a quarter?

00:41:03.350 --> 00:41:04.600
Only 80,000 yuan left

00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:07.480
-=One throw=-

00:41:07.481 --> 00:41:09.610
You have to earn money honestly.

00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:12.440
A mother who works as a nanny
for others and earns money for you

00:41:12.490 --> 00:41:13.610
Don't you feel pity for her?

00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:15.546
I would have committed suicide long ago.

00:41:15.570 --> 00:41:17.200
How can you talk like that?

00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:20.240
Some things can be said,
some things cannot be said

00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:22.120
He actually said suicide

00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:26.420
Let's go

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:27.476
Brother Jixing, please be patient

00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:29.750
What are you enduring?

00:41:31.130 --> 00:41:33.010
Really, why are you like this?

00:41:33.090 --> 00:41:34.290
Didn't we agree to be friends?

00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:35.986
I just want to play with you
because I feel sorry for you.

00:41:36.010 --> 00:41:37.840
You really thought you were friends.

00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:41.350
Come here

00:41:59.950 --> 00:42:01.990
What are you guys doing?

00:42:02.490 --> 00:42:04.910
In this case, let's not meet for now.

00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:31.310
Why didn't you answer the
phone? Where have you been?

00:42:32.110 --> 00:42:33.470
How did it become like this again?

00:42:34.110 --> 00:42:35.280
Who are you with?

00:42:35.530 --> 00:42:36.650
Are you with friends?

00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:38.860
I have no friends

00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:40.870
What are you doing alone so late?

00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:42.806
Who is your friend? Give me your number.
I've said I don't have any friends.

00:42:42.830 --> 00:42:45.910
I thought you were in trouble and ran
to the police station and the hospital.

00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:47.620
Even the morgue

00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:50.460
I even searched the morgue.

00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:51.880
I'm not feeling well now.

00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:53.339
Is it time to play with friends?

00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:56.760
Really, I have no friends.

00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:58.680
I said I have no friends

00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:00.930
None

00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:02.970
Everybody hates me

00:43:03.050 --> 00:43:05.100
I'm a useless person

00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:07.060
Since everyone hates me so much

00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:08.640
I might as well have died.

00:43:08.730 --> 00:43:10.400
Why are you dying?

00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:14.480
I'm suffocating because of my dad.

00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:16.780
It's not because my heart hurts.

00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:19.449
It's because Daddy is
about to stop beating.

00:43:19.450 --> 00:43:20.860
Am I a dog?

00:43:21.570 --> 00:43:23.990
Why did you put a dog collar on me?

00:43:25.330 --> 00:43:28.500
I'm really suffocating because of my dad.

00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:30.830
I don't need a dad at all

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:39.800
Wanshu

00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:42.340
Don't run, you'll slip.

00:44:09.250 --> 00:44:11.080
Have a cup of tea before you go.

00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:18.710
Don't bring anything here anymore.

00:44:21.050 --> 00:44:22.180
Sorry

00:44:23.890 --> 00:44:25.850
I heard you had a heart transplant.

00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:28.390
Looks like a success.

00:44:28.930 --> 00:44:30.390
Looks much better.

00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:33.810
Look, your skin has improved.

00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:37.320
Madam, you look very young.

00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:43.910
After all, I took someone else's life.

00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:45.280
Of course you have to get better.

00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:46.620
Isn't it?

00:44:49.870 --> 00:44:51.290
I was wrong

00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:53.870
The rest of life

00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:57.420
I will do good things
for the rest of my life.

00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:00.260
Do what your husband couldn't finish.

00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:02.949
Save many people

00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:05.960
I hope you don't go on living.
It's better to commit suicide again.

00:45:06.970 --> 00:45:09.530
I hope you don't fail
this time and succeed.

00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:11.909
Stop saying you're going to die.

00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:15.030
Let someone like my husband die.

00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:17.330
I hope you die

00:45:32.450 --> 00:45:33.480
Let's do it

00:45:34.370 --> 00:45:35.370
What

00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:38.150
Study this to develop new drugs

00:45:38.650 --> 00:45:40.700
- What are you talking about?
- Dean Song retired

00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:42.170
Three more years?

00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:44.279
Three years and four months

00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:45.560
After retirement

00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:48.439
Going to change the grandchildren's diapers

00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:50.560
Or be the vice president
of a pharmaceutical company?

00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:52.060
What

00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:54.580
my country

00:45:55.790 --> 00:45:57.840
It's time for a Nobel Prize in Medicine

00:45:58.100 --> 00:45:59.250
So what to do

00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:03.640
Feel like you can do it

00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:04.960
Why are you here?

00:46:05.690 --> 00:46:07.090
Have you really missed everyone?

00:46:07.610 --> 00:46:08.949
Didn't auntie say goodbye?

00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:10.930
Didn't you say you were
looking for bad guys?

00:46:11.890 --> 00:46:14.130
I have found the bad guy.
Don't look for him anymore.

00:46:16.570 --> 00:46:20.670
This, this uncle is not a bad guy, just...

00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:22.009
A bit like a minion

00:46:22.010 --> 00:46:24.120
Not that guy. I mean I'm the bad guy.

00:46:26.210 --> 00:46:27.569
You were sick too, you know.

00:46:27.570 --> 00:46:29.916
If you feel uncomfortable physically,
you will also feel uncomfortable mentally.

00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:31.980
Then I don't want to
see those powerful people

00:46:32.110 --> 00:46:35.070
I don't want to see myself hiding
behind those people and cursing at them.

00:46:35.230 --> 00:46:38.796
It is a formula for people who have accomplished
nothing and have nothing to be bad people.

00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:40.860
But you have super powers.

00:46:42.590 --> 00:46:43.810
What can this do?

00:46:45.090 --> 00:46:46.530
If I had super powers, like that guy

00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:48.136
It would be great if it
was a useful superpower.

00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:50.760
What kind of superpower is this?
It's obviously not a superpower.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.006
Are you sure you want this?

00:46:52.030 --> 00:46:53.990
That's how I am, that's
why I live like this

00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:02.490
I didn't plagiarize the script.

00:47:03.130 --> 00:47:04.209
We were supposed to write together

00:47:04.210 --> 00:47:06.460
He left and said he wanted
to write something else.

00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:09.550
Uncle

00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:13.040
Are you really playing with me
because you feel sorry for me?

00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:14.540
This sentence cancels

00:47:16.450 --> 00:47:18.310
Say sorry to Aunt Shannv.

00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:21.150
Go there and tell it yourself.

00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:23.420
Where to go

00:47:23.590 --> 00:47:25.590
They said they found a
liver transplant candidate.

00:47:26.050 --> 00:47:26.630
Monitor

00:47:27.010 --> 00:47:29.059
Now these people are not our followers.

00:47:29.060 --> 00:47:31.300
If we improve safety and treatment, etc.

00:47:31.550 --> 00:47:33.706
Then it won't be finished
before the Day of Resurrection.

00:47:33.730 --> 00:47:36.799
I climbed 50 or 60 floors without a rope.

00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:40.049
Safety first, as stated by Shinshin

00:47:40.050 --> 00:47:43.450
So where is the place blessed by the new
god? Where is the need for safety equipment?

00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:45.489
It's all because of no trust

00:47:45.490 --> 00:47:47.030
I became scared.

00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:48.420
Let’s go eat Regional Director

00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:51.760
Fifteen minutes until lunch time

00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:54.299
Let’s do it after dinner.

00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:55.420
We are not robots.

00:47:55.650 --> 00:47:57.789
- How can this be completed in one day?
- It's a robot.

00:47:57.790 --> 00:47:58.870
Let's go eat.

00:47:59.310 --> 00:48:00.650
I want to finish this today.

00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:02.709
Someone must faint.

00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:03.710
Good

00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:06.586
When you come back, bring
me a bucket of instant noodles

00:48:06.610 --> 00:48:07.699
knew

00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:08.700
good

00:48:14.070 --> 00:48:16.809
He won't come. He doesn't
want to come at all.

00:48:16.810 --> 00:48:18.810
What to do when you come?
You must give me oxygen.

00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:22.440
I've been arguing all
day over useless abilities.

00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:25.200
Excuse me

00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:26.990
I'm leaving first

00:48:27.330 --> 00:48:28.870
You go see it.

00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:30.220
Why

00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:32.490
Don't you want to find super powers?

00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:36.330
I'm sorry, Wanshu.

00:48:37.550 --> 00:48:38.889
Not eligible

00:48:38.890 --> 00:48:40.170
How can you say that?

00:48:41.070 --> 00:48:43.630
Didn't we agree to find super
powers together and become heroes?

00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:47.120
Start up

00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:49.260
You've seen me too, right?

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:51.760
I'm not qualified.

00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:55.280
I didn't... I didn't look that closely.

00:48:56.810 --> 00:48:58.970
Such a precious ability
should be used in a good place

00:48:59.630 --> 00:49:02.030
I'm sorry for causing trouble
to you all during this period.

00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:05.630
I won't do it anymore

00:49:06.490 --> 00:49:07.710
Really annoying

00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:11.459
In a world where it’s hard to feed yourself

00:49:11.460 --> 00:49:13.900
What kind of superhero is it?
Why do you want to help others?

00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:15.820
Disbanded today.

00:49:15.850 --> 00:49:17.170
The group chat was also disbanded

00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:28.620
Nothing happened

00:49:28.860 --> 00:49:29.909
Don't be nervous.

00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:31.130
What are you doing?

00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:32.420
Didn't you hear the sound?

00:49:32.460 --> 00:49:34.510
- Get out quickly.
- You just said it was nothing.

00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:36.489
The regional director
asked us to stay on the job.

00:49:36.490 --> 00:49:38.540
If you die, will the
district chief be responsible?

00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:40.820
Get out now

00:49:41.580 --> 00:49:42.730
Two lines two lines

00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:44.180
Slow down. Slow down.

00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:57.720
Where did this come from?

00:50:09.970 --> 00:50:11.630
Have you found the right path?

00:50:11.770 --> 00:50:13.630
I don't know either

00:50:18.690 --> 00:50:20.900
Lee Soo-geun

00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:25.390
Lee Soo-geun

00:50:25.391 --> 00:50:26.800
I'm here, monitor.

00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:31.190
But we were here before, right?

00:50:32.170 --> 00:50:34.069
Help!

00:50:34.070 --> 00:50:35.090
Lee Soo-geun

00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:37.570
Wear a hard hat

00:50:51.850 --> 00:50:53.450
Uncle, get out of the way

00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:33.260
Auntie, no

00:51:34.380 --> 00:51:35.849
There's someone inside

00:51:35.850 --> 00:51:37.079
Start Open Door

00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:37.920
Wait a moment

00:51:37.921 --> 00:51:39.389
Start Quickly

00:51:39.390 --> 00:51:40.609
Should I open the door?

00:51:40.610 --> 00:51:41.610
Open

00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:53.920
Sorry for last time.

00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:06.046
Are there any swimming goggles
or anything like that here?

00:52:06.070 --> 00:52:07.790
The smoke is so thick I can't see anything.

00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:10.010
Turn off the song.

00:52:11.550 --> 00:52:12.639
Start up

00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:13.640
good

00:52:27.450 --> 00:52:28.450
Found it

00:52:28.530 --> 00:52:29.899
I'll tell you, go in.

00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:32.270
Who are you to command me?

00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:34.229
I told you I would be your guide.

00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:36.599
If there is navigation, then you go in.

00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:38.509
Are you two crazy? How can you quarrel now?

00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:40.810
No, I opened the door for you.

00:52:41.260 --> 00:52:43.079
Ask me to tell you the
way, and I will tell you.

00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:44.080
What else do I need to do for you?

00:52:44.081 --> 00:52:45.729
I'm not asking you to do anything else.

00:52:45.730 --> 00:52:47.219
I asked you not to command me.

00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:49.839
You command me so I won't command you

00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:51.439
Why do you give me instructions?

00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:52.519
I didn't tell you what to do.

00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:53.969
I asked you not to command me.

00:52:53.970 --> 00:52:57.399
- You told me not to boss
you around - Damn you two

00:52:57.400 --> 00:53:00.100
As soon as they see each other,
they start to quarrel and go crazy

00:53:00.101 --> 00:53:01.679
You two are stupid.

00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:04.120
Don't let me in.

00:53:08.020 --> 00:53:09.360
Uncle, tell us the way

00:53:20.290 --> 00:53:21.620
left

00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:22.750
A little further

00:53:23.130 --> 00:53:24.280
Not there

00:53:26.110 --> 00:53:27.190
Yes, that's it.

00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:28.650
Going forward

00:53:28.730 --> 00:53:29.730
Yes, that's it.

00:53:41.910 --> 00:53:43.000
Shougen

00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:47.100
Here, here...

00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:50.700
Lee Soo-geun

00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:53.280
Hey, Shougen, wake up!

00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:21.280
Uncle

00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:25.710
Water... water?

00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:27.590
Hurry and get some water

00:54:27.650 --> 00:54:31.370
Water Water...

00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:34.540
what to do

00:54:35.330 --> 00:54:36.680
- Water - What to do? What to do?

00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:41.160
Don't just stand there,
at least do something.

00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:15.120
Auntie, what's going on?

00:55:31.830 --> 00:55:33.110
Stop

00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:36.540
Where to start

00:55:40.260 --> 00:55:42.009
Not where I am

00:55:42.010 --> 00:55:45.010
You asked me to get some water and
asked me where it was. How would I know?

00:55:46.050 --> 00:55:48.530
What about superheroes?

00:56:06.450 --> 00:56:08.580
Uncle, please go out first.

00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:13.100
I know where the water purifier is.

00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:13.740
Come with me

00:56:13.990 --> 00:56:15.839
Send him outside

00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:16.840
Please

00:56:17.950 --> 00:56:18.950
Shougen

00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:24.640
This way

00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:13.679
Just walk another hundred meters.

00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:16.180
There's no gas mask at
this construction site?

00:57:17.080 --> 00:57:18.080
Sorry

00:57:19.060 --> 00:57:21.490
I just saw a lot of tanks here

00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:23.350
Is there such a thing as an oxygen tank?

00:57:23.860 --> 00:57:25.910
Here comes the oxygen tank

00:57:37.850 --> 00:57:38.870
Not over there

00:59:06.490 --> 00:59:08.279
My name is Xu Yaoshan

00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:09.750
Had a liver transplant

00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:13.179
Occasionally treat existing
underlying medical conditions

00:59:13.180 --> 00:59:16.069
Fractures and injuries
caused by accidents alone

00:59:16.070 --> 00:59:18.179
Shoulder discomfort, chronic fatigue, etc.

00:59:18.180 --> 00:59:20.550
I can cure them all.

00:59:20.930 --> 00:59:23.170
If you need anything, tell me.

00:59:24.770 --> 00:59:26.869
Are you also a designated driver?

00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:29.050
-My dad does it, too. -Just now I saw you

00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:32.319
You seem to be transferring
other people's pain away

00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:35.010
It's okay. I just need a glass of water.

00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:36.200
It will be fine

00:59:36.530 --> 00:59:37.530
real

00:59:38.060 --> 00:59:41.010
People like you are truly heroes.

00:59:41.070 --> 00:59:41.640
Isn't it?

00:59:42.090 --> 00:59:43.090
Applaud

00:59:43.540 --> 00:59:44.540
applaud

00:59:45.670 --> 00:59:46.670
Miss What

00:59:47.010 --> 00:59:50.410
I think you are a real hero

00:59:50.610 --> 00:59:52.399
And saved my life

00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:54.520
Thank you very much

01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:06.449
What what

01:00:06.450 --> 01:00:07.789
What are you looking at?

01:00:07.790 --> 01:00:09.619
Ah, Auntie, don't cry.

01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:11.829
You were cursing just now. Why are you
crying now? This doesn't suit you at all.

01:00:11.830 --> 01:00:13.420
This is even more terrifying

01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:20.129
Actually, I used to have depression
and anger regulation disorder.

01:00:20.130 --> 01:00:21.339
I have to take medicine vigorously

01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:23.799
Then after the operation,
the patient became healthy.

01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:25.800
Do you think things have
really gotten better now?

01:00:25.930 --> 01:00:28.470
- I thought swearing was your superpower.
- Ouch

01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:30.849
Forget about what happened just now

01:00:30.850 --> 01:00:34.229
Should we give each of our heroes a name?

01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:35.519
What's the name again?

01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:39.109
No, don't you see those
foreign superhero movies?

01:00:39.110 --> 01:00:41.149
What kind of hero, what kind of woman

01:00:41.150 --> 01:00:44.369
As for me, I rely on my
strength to save people.

01:00:44.370 --> 01:00:46.699
How about saving women? The
abbreviation is saving women.

01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:48.080
Do you think it's OK?

01:00:49.330 --> 01:00:50.369
The English word is "NINE" ("救"
is pronounced the same as "九").

01:00:50.370 --> 01:00:51.370
NINE GIRL

01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:53.789
- Uh... - Uncle, you are an oxygen tank

01:00:53.790 --> 01:00:55.460
Jar Jar Boy Bar Jar Jar Boy

01:00:56.210 --> 01:00:57.459
What's your name, Auntie?

01:00:57.460 --> 01:01:01.879
I was originally doing fresh delivery and
was thinking of calling myself 'Fresh Girl'

01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:03.969
Is that a bit like that?

01:01:03.970 --> 01:01:09.010
But fresh girl is more
catchy than fresh woman, right?

01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:10.060
Just call it that.

01:01:10.061 --> 01:01:11.350
As long as we don't call you.

01:01:13.850 --> 01:01:17.059
- Your name is Yaoshan. - Yes

01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:20.530
Let's call it medicine hand.
The hand is medicine hand.

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:24.569
You, because your name is Startup

01:01:24.570 --> 01:01:28.989
- Bluetooth Man, the wireless one.
- Oh, ok, ok.

01:01:28.990 --> 01:01:29.990
Hey, save the girl

01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:34.539
- You are a bad student, right?
- My dad said that he just wants me to be healthy.

01:01:34.540 --> 01:01:40.210
I actually have a name in mind.

01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:44.130
I can save people and replenish my energy.

01:01:44.930 --> 01:01:45.970
Battery Man

01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:52.220
- Everyone uses English names, so it can be unified.
- Yeah, OK. Battery

01:01:52.810 --> 01:01:55.889
Okay, we've come up with a name
and the atmosphere is pretty good.

01:01:55.890 --> 01:02:00.480
Bluetooth Man, in line with
today's atmosphere, music follows you

01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:04.570
Super amazing

01:02:04.571 --> 01:02:07.700
But uncle, this is
really amazing, look at it

01:02:08.910 --> 01:02:09.910
Action

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.010
again

01:02:23.590 --> 01:02:24.670
Enough

01:02:32.430 --> 01:02:35.980
-=Barcelona Taekwondo=-

01:02:37.390 --> 01:02:38.480
Where did you go?

01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:40.230
Go meet friends

01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:42.109
Didn't you say you have no friends?

01:02:42.110 --> 01:02:43.280
I made friends

01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:47.110
- Do you need my help?
- You don't have the strength

01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:50.800
You will get hurt. Get out of the way.

01:02:57.830 --> 01:02:58.869
See?

01:02:58.870 --> 01:03:00.669
Dad is still okay, right?

01:03:00.670 --> 01:03:02.840
- It's OK. - Since it's OK

01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:06.969
Leave everything to Dad, okay?

01:03:06.970 --> 01:03:08.470
- Dad. - Where's Dad?

01:03:08.550 --> 01:03:13.430
Even if you become an old
lady, as long as you call me dad

01:03:14.010 --> 01:03:17.390
I will also appear like a hero
and help you solve all the problems.

01:03:20.060 --> 01:03:21.560
Colds are bad for your health

01:03:22.150 --> 01:03:24.990
I have to go to the hospital tomorrow.
You should go back to bed early.

01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:31.160
Sai Shen Hospital prays
for a speedy recovery

01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:35.200
Always focus...

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:38.330
Sorry, please take the next elevator

01:03:39.210 --> 01:03:40.210
Feel sorry

01:03:41.630 --> 01:03:43.419
What you may experience during treatment...

01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:45.000
Come up, fellow believers.

01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:48.920
Which department?

01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:50.719
The Eternal Life Wing Chun Sai God Descends

01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:54.469
I am Xu Yaoshan, the stage equipment
construction team leader of Saishen Group.

01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:55.470
It's a pleasure to meet you

01:03:55.471 --> 01:03:57.469
Were you scared by the
explosion a while ago?

01:03:57.470 --> 01:03:59.230
- Are you hurt? - I'm fine.

01:03:59.770 --> 01:04:00.600
Thank you for your concern

01:04:00.601 --> 01:04:02.860
Thank you for your faith.

01:04:04.310 --> 01:04:05.310
Yes

01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:06.980
I will try harder to believe

01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:12.570
The Eternal Life Wing Chun Sai God Descends

01:04:34.090 --> 01:04:35.219
You got a tattoo?

01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:38.969
This is not a tattoo. I was lucky
enough to have an organ transplant.

01:04:38.970 --> 01:04:40.100
What was transplanted

01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:42.416
Underwent liver transplantation

01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:44.100
Did anything change after the transplant?

01:04:44.650 --> 01:04:49.069
The surgery went well and my body became healthy and I don't feel tired anymore...
- I'm not talking about that.

01:04:49.070 --> 01:04:50.590
Is it that you have any special place?

01:04:53.950 --> 01:04:55.530
Although I'm not sure

01:04:57.330 --> 01:04:59.240
But people say I look younger.

01:05:11.010 --> 01:05:13.370
Of course, you need to rely
on your liver to become younger

01:05:13.550 --> 01:05:14.550
What's your name?

01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:17.220
My name is Xu Yaoshan

01:05:17.550 --> 01:05:19.720
Xu Yaoshan, Construction Team Leader

01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:22.020
Take good care of your body

01:05:22.890 --> 01:05:23.890
See you next time

01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:28.150
-=A book to help you
learn how to be a nurse=-

01:05:28.150 --> 01:05:30.900
Looks like she's preparing
for the nursing exam.
-=A book to help you
learn how to be a nurse=-

01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:30.940
-=A book to help you
learn how to be a nurse=-

01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:33.900
No, just watching for fun
-=A book to help you
learn how to be a nurse=-

01:05:33.900 --> 01:05:33.990
-=A book to help you
learn how to be a nurse=-

01:05:33.990 --> 01:05:34.950
Wow, so cool
-=A book to help you
learn how to be a nurse=-

01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:36.070
Wow, so cool

01:05:36.530 --> 01:05:39.699
I'm so sorry, driver.

01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:41.789
Suddenly said we want to meet here

01:05:41.790 --> 01:05:42.990
Do you need me to turn around?

01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:44.870
Ouch. I'm so sorry.

01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:48.710
Let me see where the Saishen
Pharmaceutical Headquarters is.

01:05:49.250 --> 01:05:52.590
Oh, Saishen Pharmaceuticals?
I work next door.

01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:54.550
I know the way

01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:56.589
Very good

01:05:56.590 --> 01:06:00.260
- Please get through safely. - Okay.

01:06:00.430 --> 01:06:02.640
- Do you have any gum?
- Do you have any gum?

01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:06.650
Why not start

01:06:07.190 --> 01:06:08.230
Yeah

01:06:08.810 --> 01:06:12.320
This first requires a
pathological examination

01:06:12.570 --> 01:06:15.450
Even a lethal dose of
anesthesia would not work

01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:17.570
Is it Little Sai Shen?

01:06:18.700 --> 01:06:22.200
Great! I am Xu Yaoshan, the
construction team leader of Saishen Group.

01:06:22.910 --> 01:06:26.369
Little Sai Shen, where is
this? I... want to go home.

01:06:26.370 --> 01:06:32.130
Oh, by the way, there is a book that will
teach you how to be a nurse. I forgot that.

01:06:32.550 --> 01:06:34.549
- We have to go there...
- What's the anesthesia?

01:06:34.550 --> 01:06:35.550
Directly

01:06:39.430 --> 01:06:42.969
Little Sai Shen

01:06:42.970 --> 01:06:44.730
Shut up

01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:46.770
Little Sai Shen

01:06:48.150 --> 01:06:51.110
Since anesthesia doesn't work, we
have to find a way to make him pass out.

01:06:51.860 --> 01:06:53.069
What are you standing there
for? Why don't you start?

01:06:53.070 --> 01:06:54.650
-Yes. -Who are you waiting for?

01:06:55.030 --> 01:06:56.530
Are you waiting for me?

01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:01.490
The Eternal Life Wing Chun Sai God Descends

01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:06.790
You have planned
something very interesting.

01:07:10.540 --> 01:07:14.249
See you again, Xu Yaoshan, construction
team leader, it's okay, it's okay

01:07:14.250 --> 01:07:16.470
Who did it?

01:07:17.220 --> 01:07:19.509
Dean Song is a Saishen

01:07:19.510 --> 01:07:22.349
I heard that if you take just a little
bit of the liver it will grow back.

01:07:22.350 --> 01:07:24.220
- Right? - Yes, that's right.

01:07:25.850 --> 01:07:28.270
The Eternal Life Wing Chun Sai God Descends

01:07:28.890 --> 01:07:32.610
Become a sleeping sacrifice
and live forever in my body

01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:55.340
Doctor Kim tied up

01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:16.400
sorry

01:08:16.819 --> 01:08:18.649
It seems that the same kind cannot

01:08:20.950 --> 01:08:21.950
Then let's do surgery.

01:08:43.010 --> 01:08:44.970
- Mr. Zhao - Yes, President

01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:48.810
It's better to strike first.

01:08:49.979 --> 01:08:51.729
Catch them all

01:08:53.810 --> 01:08:56.109
Take it easy. Ouch. Take it easy.

01:09:10.830 --> 01:09:12.290
Auntie, this way

01:09:12.660 --> 01:09:14.040
Okay, here we come

01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:18.420
Oh, thank you.

01:09:32.140 --> 01:09:38.109
- Is there anything to drink?
- Yes, yes, yes. How could there be nothing?

01:09:50.990 --> 01:09:53.119
Daughter, daughter,
daughter, what are you doing?

01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:55.370
What are you doing? Is
your leg okay? It's okay...

01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:57.790
Hey, this is simple.

01:09:58.380 --> 01:10:00.959
Hey, isn't it just a child?

01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:02.090
Who are you?

01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:04.089
- Let's go. - Where are we going?

01:10:04.090 --> 01:10:05.090
Very soon

01:10:05.091 --> 01:10:07.890
Daughter, go over there, far away

01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:09.680
Go to the very edge

01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:30.120
Ahhh my waist my waist I
almost thought I was going to die

01:10:31.910 --> 01:10:34.200
Pause Pause Pause

01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:47.760
Go up again

01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:14.660
come on

01:11:14.661 --> 01:11:16.080
All together up

01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:18.080
Ah damn

01:11:51.610 --> 01:11:53.580
Hey, do you know 540 degree rotation?

01:11:59.830 --> 01:12:00.580
Oh mom

01:12:00.630 --> 01:12:03.590
Xinqi finished eating a long time
ago. I'll give you the empty bucket now.

01:12:07.090 --> 01:12:09.009
Didn't I tell you to call
dad if you have any problem?

01:12:09.010 --> 01:12:09.970
Get me some water

01:12:09.971 --> 01:12:11.611
- Water. - There's something in that bag.

01:12:15.230 --> 01:12:19.510
-=Free gift event: All customers who purchase more than
50,000 won will receive a free Bluetooth speaker =-

01:12:44.420 --> 01:12:46.299
I just said it

01:12:46.300 --> 01:12:48.009
You got the wrong guy, sir.

01:12:48.010 --> 01:12:50.050
-=Photoelectric Fire Detector=-
Let me out first.

01:12:59.230 --> 01:13:00.309
Please let me go

01:13:00.310 --> 01:13:02.899
Did my father promise to give you a job?

01:13:02.900 --> 01:13:05.610
I don't need an official
position. What I want is very simple.

01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:08.110
A few Nobel Prizes are enough

01:13:11.370 --> 01:13:14.080
You're on the wrong side

01:13:15.790 --> 01:13:17.590
It's no use for an old
man to become younger.

01:13:17.870 --> 01:13:20.130
Who do you think will live longer?

01:13:21.670 --> 01:13:23.040
Go check it out.

01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:34.720
Who are you

01:13:35.180 --> 01:13:37.941
Why did you come just now? I've
been waiting for you for a long time.

01:13:45.150 --> 01:13:46.939
Who are you, bastard?

01:13:46.940 --> 01:13:48.359
Have you been drinking in broad daylight?

01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:50.240
Why don't you recognize me, your father?

01:13:50.950 --> 01:13:52.779
Did I tell you

01:13:52.780 --> 01:13:55.660
Your father was a handsome
man when he was young.

01:16:47.830 --> 01:16:49.710
Plz follow me

01:16:50.290 --> 01:16:53.590
This way, follow me.

01:16:54.300 --> 01:16:57.930
- This preacher - Be
careful on the steps, go up

01:16:58.470 --> 01:17:00.179
Follow this way too

01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:02.219
Newcomers, please follow me here.

01:17:02.220 --> 01:17:04.810
- This is it. - Welcome.

01:17:15.530 --> 01:17:18.150
Where is my clone?

01:17:18.490 --> 01:17:19.609
Have no idea

01:17:19.610 --> 01:17:22.409
There must be someone left
before I can become a god.

01:17:22.410 --> 01:17:23.580
Aren't you afraid?

01:17:24.330 --> 01:17:27.410
If God really exists, aren't you
afraid that you will be punished?

01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:31.999
Have you been to church recently?

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.000
Dad

01:17:33.001 --> 01:17:35.049
Because I know I won't be forgiven

01:17:35.050 --> 01:17:36.550
That’s why I want to be God.

01:17:46.140 --> 01:17:49.230
How clever! Hiding it here!

01:17:51.190 --> 01:17:52.979
Director Zhao, long time no see.

01:17:52.980 --> 01:17:54.149
Who are you

01:17:54.150 --> 01:17:55.779
Why are you playing
dumb? You clearly know it.

01:17:55.780 --> 01:17:57.070
I have no idea

01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:02.530
Don't be too harsh. The president
asked us to invite him formally.

01:18:44.530 --> 01:18:49.830
Numbness Numbness

01:18:50.540 --> 01:18:53.290
-=Really? Where are you?;;;;=-

01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:19.360
What's going on?

01:19:19.730 --> 01:19:20.740
Did you open the door?

01:19:21.150 --> 01:19:23.200
Didn't we come here together?

01:19:23.990 --> 01:19:26.740
Why don't you untie this? Untie it for me.

01:19:27.410 --> 01:19:29.290
Hello Park Joo-chan Park Joo-chan

01:19:30.750 --> 01:19:32.159
This bastard

01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:34.249
Auntie Auntie

01:19:34.250 --> 01:19:36.210
Don't mess with me Don't mess with me

01:19:45.510 --> 01:19:46.590
-=Huang Qidong, save me!!=-

01:19:47.470 --> 01:19:49.430
-=Huang Qidong, save me!!
We are all kidnapped!=-

01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:53.680
-=Uncle, where are you?
Send me your address now=-

01:20:08.450 --> 01:20:10.829
The eyes are definitely not allowed

01:20:10.830 --> 01:20:12.500
My eyes are really not good.

01:20:14.210 --> 01:20:17.210
Absolutely not my eyes, if you want
to take it, take my reproductive organs

01:20:17.460 --> 01:20:19.340
He's really good at pretending to be sick.

01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:24.339
Corneal transplant should be done soon.

01:20:24.340 --> 01:20:25.469
Yes

01:20:25.470 --> 01:20:28.469
Eyes not working

01:20:28.470 --> 01:20:30.630
How nice it would be if the
rest of us did it together

01:20:31.310 --> 01:20:33.269
- I'm still missing one person.
- I'm a rich man.

01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:35.139
- I can give you a lot of money
- Just to be on the safe side

01:20:35.140 --> 01:20:37.439
- It's better to have more time.
- I'll give you a lot of money.

01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:39.980
How much is enough, you bastards?

01:20:40.610 --> 01:20:42.439
Can you give him anesthesia?

01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:45.070
Xu Yaoshan was so noisy
that he even fell into a coma

01:20:45.860 --> 01:20:49.620
But it must be painful.

01:21:04.380 --> 01:21:05.629
No what

01:21:05.630 --> 01:21:06.670
Nothing works I have to go

01:21:07.260 --> 01:21:09.510
No, no, absolutely not this time. You...

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:14.100
Do you think I don't
know what you're doing?

01:21:16.390 --> 01:21:17.729
Since when did you know

01:21:17.730 --> 01:21:21.309
Parents smell their children's farts

01:21:21.310 --> 01:21:23.190
You can all tell what's on this kid's mind.

01:21:23.770 --> 01:21:26.850
You've been in the hospital for three
years and you haven't made any friends.

01:21:27.950 --> 01:21:30.240
After I got better, I
finally made some friends.

01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:32.800
The same is true of the friends you make.

01:21:35.750 --> 01:21:37.140
Hanging out with bad boys

01:21:40.210 --> 01:21:42.340
Even if I buy you new shoes every time

01:21:42.610 --> 01:21:45.220
When I came back, my shoes were
all broken and became garbage.

01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:50.129
My daughter, I'm sorry, my daughter

01:21:50.130 --> 01:21:52.800
So I study Taekwondo hard.

01:21:53.300 --> 01:21:56.196
All for the sake of not getting beaten.
All for the sake of not getting beaten.

01:21:56.220 --> 01:21:57.599
Because bad boys bullied you

01:21:57.600 --> 01:21:59.690
- That's why you want to protect yourself.
- Dad

01:22:00.350 --> 01:22:03.980
-But what if I get hurt again? -Actually

01:22:04.050 --> 01:22:06.460
My friends were caught by the bad boys

01:22:06.510 --> 01:22:08.739
Don't go. Don't go. Don't go.

01:22:08.740 --> 01:22:11.199
We are like a family

01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:12.410
So I have to rescue them.

01:22:12.490 --> 01:22:15.450
Really not

01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:21.539
You're standing right
behind me, you bastards

01:22:21.540 --> 01:22:23.419
It's the group of people
in black suits, right?

01:22:23.420 --> 01:22:25.000
Age is just a number

01:22:25.590 --> 01:22:26.959
Do you want to change the song?

01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:29.549
I still get excited when I hear this song.

01:22:29.550 --> 01:22:32.009
I also listened to this song
when I went on stage in Barcelona

01:22:32.010 --> 01:22:33.049
I won the championship

01:22:33.050 --> 01:22:34.509
What's your dad's nickname?

01:22:34.510 --> 01:22:36.309
-Taekwondo Injustice -Taekwondo Injustice

01:22:36.310 --> 01:22:39.890
A fatal spinning kick full of justice

01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:50.240
What's wrong

01:22:50.950 --> 01:22:53.449
What's wrong? Wake up.

01:22:53.450 --> 01:22:55.030
Why are you here? Where is this place?

01:22:56.450 --> 01:22:57.950
It seems we have been kidnapped.

01:22:59.540 --> 01:23:00.870
Let's go out first.

01:23:07.130 --> 01:23:08.629
Where is the toilet?

01:23:08.630 --> 01:23:10.129
No, not there.

01:23:10.130 --> 01:23:11.130
No

01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:17.349
How are you

01:23:17.350 --> 01:23:19.310
This is so interesting. It's amazing.

01:23:19.850 --> 01:23:22.520
You have never seen WIFI
with your naked eyes, right?

01:23:24.980 --> 01:23:26.730
Is it because only one eye was removed?

01:23:27.230 --> 01:23:28.819
Focus is good and bad

01:23:28.820 --> 01:23:32.780
I'm sorry, it's all his fault for
waking up suddenly and rushing over

01:23:33.030 --> 01:23:35.239
His cornea was transplanted
into only one of my eyes.

01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:36.529
It makes me feel uncomfortable.

01:23:36.530 --> 01:23:38.280
He must have seen this.

01:23:38.410 --> 01:23:39.850
Can you still do this kind of thing?

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.120
Severe damage during removal

01:23:43.620 --> 01:23:46.080
Modern medicine cannot restore

01:23:59.430 --> 01:24:00.599
Who?

01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:01.600
It's me

01:24:02.260 --> 01:24:03.340
Battery Man

01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:04.979
Uncle, please help me heal

01:24:04.980 --> 01:24:06.600
Can't you treat it?

01:24:07.270 --> 01:24:09.189
The battery is dead

01:24:09.190 --> 01:24:11.150
Can't you recover by drinking water?

01:24:11.530 --> 01:24:12.689
Drink some water and help me heal.

01:24:12.690 --> 01:24:14.650
Didn’t I bring you water last time?

01:24:14.990 --> 01:24:19.370
Uncle, help me, I'm so scared

01:24:20.790 --> 01:24:23.499
How did he survive?

01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:27.330
They were able to remove
my two organs twice.

01:24:29.090 --> 01:24:30.800

Welcome to all the saints

Now, as he said, according
to the Lord's promise

01:24:49.730 --> 01:24:52.319
Returned with a new body that never dies

01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:53.899
Save us from the fire of hell

01:24:53.900 --> 01:24:57.069
To punish the unbelievers,
He descended into us.

01:24:57.070 --> 01:24:58.489
Welcome to the King of Kings, God of Gods

01:24:58.490 --> 01:25:00.699

Saishen

01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:20.970
What's going on?

01:25:23.430 --> 01:25:24.430
Who is this

Eternal immortality
beyond the physical body

01:25:45.910 --> 01:25:48.119
I promised that when we meet again

01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:50.919
I will stand before
you in my youthful body.

01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:52.879
Those who believe in me and follow me

01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:55.500
Will be my people

Indestructible by fire, body of steel

I smashed the boulder
we promised on that day

01:26:34.540 --> 01:26:36.089
Focus on you

01:26:36.090 --> 01:26:37.879
Those who believe in me and follow me

01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:40.340
Will be my people

01:27:06.150 --> 01:27:07.400
Wait a moment

Sai Theism

01:29:26.970 --> 01:29:28.700
Why are there so many entrances?

01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:30.960
Are there any artists coming?

01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:50.870
Scare me

01:29:54.670 --> 01:29:55.700
I was scared to death

01:29:56.920 --> 01:29:58.670
I told you not to run.

You are Wanshu

01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:43.720
Brother, who are you?

01:30:43.750 --> 01:30:44.820
She's really good looking.

01:30:46.770 --> 01:30:48.370
Park Jong-min Ouch

Barcelona hero

01:30:50.970 --> 01:30:53.620
I got into a lot of
fights when I was a kid.

01:30:54.250 --> 01:30:55.250
Nice to meet you

01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:03.920
Damn

01:31:27.500 --> 01:31:28.500
It hurts, okay?

01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:32.050
How do you educate your children?

01:31:32.220 --> 01:31:34.150
- I'm sorry...

01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:39.050
But you're talking to me like this now?

01:31:40.350 --> 01:31:42.070
You are a bad boy.

01:31:42.820 --> 01:31:45.100
Always say you, you, your to adults

01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:47.749
You bastard, don't you
have a father at home?

01:31:47.750 --> 01:31:48.970
Of course not at home.

01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:51.719
My father was born in 1905

01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:53.250
Brother, did you capture my friends?

01:31:55.450 --> 01:31:57.650
My daughter actually did it.

01:31:57.870 --> 01:31:59.769
- My daughter?
- She has been correcting herself recently.

01:31:59.770 --> 01:32:00.890
Anyway, a little bit of that

01:32:01.850 --> 01:32:02.850
alright

01:32:03.300 --> 01:32:07.220
Okay, now that everyone has introduced their family
situations, it's time to get down to business.

01:32:07.850 --> 01:32:08.850
Wanshu

01:32:09.970 --> 01:32:11.399
Let me use your heart.

01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:12.850
Is this guy crazy?

01:32:15.620 --> 01:32:17.120
Hey, you guy

01:32:29.520 --> 01:32:30.720
NINE GIRL

01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:32.120
- Are you okay? - Yeah

01:32:32.170 --> 01:32:34.200
I was planning to pick you up.

01:32:34.220 --> 01:32:36.249
- You're just in time. But how did you get here?
- Ouch.

01:32:36.250 --> 01:32:38.170
This should be your father, right?

01:32:38.420 --> 01:32:39.696
- Hello. - Taekwondo. Taekwondo.

01:32:39.720 --> 01:32:41.070
It's the final farewell.

01:32:41.220 --> 01:32:42.619
- I have to say hello.

01:32:42.620 --> 01:32:45.300
I am a fresh girl

01:32:45.550 --> 01:32:47.219
This is the Jar Man

01:32:47.220 --> 01:32:48.020
- Stop it. - Hey

01:32:48.021 --> 01:32:51.350
- You are so lucky to have such an amazing daughter.
- Yes.

01:32:51.420 --> 01:32:52.320
You must be at ease.

01:32:52.321 --> 01:32:56.200
No, this child is still young and
weak. I am very worried about her.

01:32:56.320 --> 01:32:58.360
What about you, Jar Girl?
Do you have any children?

01:32:58.720 --> 01:32:59.720
I am a fresh girl

01:32:59.721 --> 01:33:01.270
Cans... good

01:33:02.820 --> 01:33:04.169
Kim Sunnyeo, let me say something too

01:33:04.170 --> 01:33:04.820
Who are you

01:33:04.821 --> 01:33:07.919
I am the Eternal Life,
Wing Chun, Sai Shen, Coming

01:33:07.920 --> 01:33:08.920
Uncle

01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:11.440
I think that brother is a
bad guy because he has tattoos

01:33:12.870 --> 01:33:15.270
But why is that person the
elder brother and I am the uncle?

01:33:15.370 --> 01:33:16.470
He is handsome.

01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:22.270
Uncle, you are the type who needs care.

01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:27.420
The adults are talking. Do you
want to keep interrupting them rudely?

01:33:27.820 --> 01:33:28.820
That

01:33:29.350 --> 01:33:31.720
Where is the startup and Mr. Xu Yaoshan?

01:33:34.350 --> 01:33:35.420
Eaten by me

01:33:36.950 --> 01:33:37.970
- Brat. - Don't.

01:33:38.020 --> 01:33:39.020
Wait a moment

01:33:39.450 --> 01:33:41.670
Hello Hello Hello

01:33:52.650 --> 01:33:54.120
Not dead?

01:35:08.100 --> 01:35:09.770
What to do

01:35:09.950 --> 01:35:11.170
I...

01:35:11.250 --> 01:35:13.550
Hey, hurry up, he's coming. He's coming.

01:35:14.550 --> 01:35:15.570
Park Ji-sung

01:35:16.150 --> 01:35:17.150
Lung transplantation

01:35:17.250 --> 01:35:18.989
Oh, your profession...

01:35:18.990 --> 01:35:21.100
Drool Launch

01:35:28.450 --> 01:35:29.950
He shouldn't be dead.

01:35:30.470 --> 01:35:32.020
But what did you just say?

01:35:33.420 --> 01:35:36.620
Usually you have to show your special
moves before you use them. This is polite.

01:35:38.750 --> 01:35:40.650
The saliva is so dirty
that I can't stand it

01:35:41.670 --> 01:35:44.170
What did you just say you were doing?

01:35:47.070 --> 01:35:48.070
What he is saying

01:35:58.520 --> 01:36:00.050
Oh my god

01:36:00.170 --> 01:36:01.170
What?

01:36:05.070 --> 01:36:06.070
Wait a moment

01:36:07.470 --> 01:36:08.470
emission

01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:18.600
Let me see

01:36:18.920 --> 01:36:21.820
Our Kim Sunnyeo is here

01:36:40.500 --> 01:36:42.400
There is a way.

01:36:43.020 --> 01:36:47.399
If our Kim Sunnyeo stood by me, we wouldn't
have to go through so much trouble.

01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:48.500
Help me once.

01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:51.399
It's a piece of cake to
transfer their abilities to me.

01:36:51.400 --> 01:36:52.999
Don't come over here. Go away.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:56.150
Transfer it to me. If you run out of
ability, I will help you fill it up.

01:36:56.600 --> 01:36:58.499
No need to bleed. How neat!

01:36:58.500 --> 01:36:59.500
Otherwise

01:36:59.820 --> 01:37:01.570
Should I buy you a Yakult company?

01:37:11.750 --> 01:37:14.000
Give me back my eyeballs

01:37:15.650 --> 01:37:18.400
Song Haolin is really annoying

01:37:48.220 --> 01:37:52.249
Become a true sacrifice
and live forever in my body

01:37:52.250 --> 01:37:53.650
Why are you doing this?

01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:58.800
I have two unfulfilled wishes in my life.

01:37:59.620 --> 01:38:01.000
One is youth

01:38:03.620 --> 01:38:06.740
What's the other one? You have to ask
me for the lines before you can take it.

01:38:08.950 --> 01:38:11.846
- The other one is Yong...
- You will definitely say it is God, you don't even need to look at it

01:38:11.870 --> 01:38:13.770
The need for a visible God

01:38:14.420 --> 01:38:18.169
I became a god to save
mankind. You must be saying this.

01:38:18.170 --> 01:38:20.499
I think you've been to a cult school.

01:38:20.500 --> 01:38:23.349
Writing lines like this these
days will get you low marks.

01:38:23.350 --> 01:38:25.569
You really ruin people's mood.

01:38:25.570 --> 01:38:27.949
This guy is a famous
troll in the neighborhood.

01:38:27.950 --> 01:38:28.950
Father Sai

01:38:29.300 --> 01:38:30.850
Yes, Xu Yaoshan

01:38:32.170 --> 01:38:33.470
Is everything fake?

01:38:34.350 --> 01:38:36.800
Is everything you show fake?

01:38:37.370 --> 01:38:38.820
I abandoned my brothers and family

01:38:39.070 --> 01:38:41.700
All-night driving for your property

01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:44.000
Dedicated to your life

01:38:45.420 --> 01:38:47.900
Were we all deceived? Was it all in vain?

01:38:48.300 --> 01:38:49.300
Um

01:38:49.870 --> 01:38:52.269
So if you really want to see God

01:38:52.270 --> 01:38:54.850
Just give me your lowly bodies.

01:38:57.250 --> 01:39:00.170
Give me back my eyes, you bastard.

01:39:04.070 --> 01:39:05.420
Go away Go away

01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:06.600
What are you doing here?

01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:09.400
Mother

01:39:10.420 --> 01:39:11.600
Scare me

01:40:13.300 --> 01:40:14.819
You should dye your hair.

01:40:14.820 --> 01:40:15.820
Don't do it

01:40:43.300 --> 01:40:46.900
Give him all our wealth.

01:41:03.010 --> 01:41:04.450
Oh my god, what should I do?

01:41:06.060 --> 01:41:07.060
What's going on?

01:41:21.220 --> 01:41:23.140
-=Do not approach, please
watch with your eyes=-

01:41:37.900 --> 01:41:44.369
New God Father New God Father

01:41:44.370 --> 01:41:45.790
This can't be done

01:41:45.910 --> 01:41:46.790
What?

01:41:46.791 --> 01:41:50.100
If we open them all at
this time, we will all die.

01:42:14.190 --> 01:42:16.640
Wait a minute, stop it, get out of the way

01:42:16.710 --> 01:42:17.890
Let me breathe

01:42:28.210 --> 01:42:30.290
Are you going to kill everyone up there?

01:42:31.100 --> 01:42:33.519
Are you going to kill everyone
who believes in you and follows you?

01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:35.380
The believers just need to be reunited

01:42:36.110 --> 01:42:38.500
My image is the god of death

01:42:47.580 --> 01:42:49.160
This is caused by you

Eternal Life New God

01:43:13.580 --> 01:43:17.340
Will become a part of
me, an eternal existence

01:43:19.140 --> 01:43:21.530
Jin Shannyu, give it to me now

01:43:24.730 --> 01:43:26.640
Otherwise you will all die.

01:43:28.690 --> 01:43:31.919
Wake up and open your eyes

01:43:31.920 --> 01:43:35.260
Wake up, Jiang Wanshu, hello

01:43:43.780 --> 01:43:46.570
Go to hell, asshole.

01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:21.479
Brat

01:45:21.480 --> 01:45:23.370
Go over there. Don't come over here.

01:46:26.880 --> 01:46:29.330
-NINE GIRL -Hey Wanshu

01:46:32.810 --> 01:46:36.179
We will witness the coming of the new god

01:46:36.180 --> 01:46:37.810
Pray now

01:46:42.340 --> 01:46:43.760
Uncle, how do I turn that off?

01:46:44.770 --> 01:46:46.459
I don't know either

01:46:46.460 --> 01:46:48.150
How could you not know

01:46:48.720 --> 01:46:51.309
You have to use something like an
intradermal needle to disperse it.

01:46:51.310 --> 01:46:53.060
But I'm not a technician

01:46:53.950 --> 01:46:55.050
sorry

01:46:56.540 --> 01:46:58.050
Give me the tattoos

01:47:00.120 --> 01:47:01.420
What are you going to do?

01:47:01.910 --> 01:47:04.870
I don't know. I have to try.

01:47:23.900 --> 01:47:26.949
Hey, if you succeed, admit
that you are the same age as me

01:47:26.950 --> 01:47:28.560
If you succeed, I'll be your brother.

01:48:22.670 --> 01:48:23.670
What are you doing?

01:48:43.480 --> 01:48:46.350
- What? - The power is out.

01:49:14.150 --> 01:49:15.830
It's all done, just give me back my tattoo

01:49:16.350 --> 01:49:17.640
I am your brother

01:49:21.210 --> 01:49:23.410
Hey, stop tying me up, hold my hand

01:49:23.480 --> 01:49:25.230
- Wait a minute. - Give it to me first.

01:49:30.500 --> 01:49:31.530
Caught

01:49:50.960 --> 01:49:53.419
Why do you want to win me?

01:49:53.420 --> 01:49:55.679
People like you have to take
it out when I tell you to.

01:49:55.680 --> 01:49:56.510
If you are told to die, you must die.

01:49:56.511 --> 01:49:57.549
Enough is enough

01:50:15.870 --> 01:50:17.099
My child

01:50:17.100 --> 01:50:20.089
How come it's so dirty?

01:50:20.090 --> 01:50:22.529
Did you fall down? Did anyone hit you?

01:50:22.530 --> 01:50:25.189
Who hit my weak daughter?

01:50:25.190 --> 01:50:31.240
Daddy is sorry for not
coming here earlier. I'm sorry.

01:50:31.520 --> 01:50:35.390
Is my daughter okay? It's Dad
who's sorry for you. I'm sorry.

01:50:35.650 --> 01:50:38.030
Ouch, Dad, I'm sorry.

01:50:42.550 --> 01:50:44.990
A brat

Do you want to be a leader?

01:51:37.550 --> 01:51:39.180
I want to be a nurse

01:52:24.540 --> 01:52:26.810
Damn

01:52:29.400 --> 01:52:30.940
It hurts

01:52:34.780 --> 01:52:37.750
Oh, I'm going to drive. Wait
a minute. I'm going to drive.

01:52:39.320 --> 01:52:40.650
Ouch

01:52:40.980 --> 01:52:42.330
what to do

01:52:44.730 --> 01:52:48.040
Ah, what should I do? The lactic
acid bacteria must have gone bad.

01:52:48.520 --> 01:52:50.640
I want to deliver it at night.

01:52:51.030 --> 01:52:55.170
I also ordered a lot of Vietnamese
spring rolls to lose weight

01:52:56.710 --> 01:52:58.360
The parking lot is this way.

That is to say

01:53:05.420 --> 01:53:07.340
We don't have anything to do.

01:53:07.740 --> 01:53:10.240
Listen to a song while you wait

01:53:11.060 --> 01:53:12.170
Which song to play?

01:53:12.460 --> 01:53:13.589
Never mind. I'll let it go.

01:53:13.590 --> 01:53:14.590
Play that song

01:53:15.090 --> 01:53:16.090
Don't want to hear that

01:53:16.650 --> 01:53:17.650
Do you know what it is?

01:53:18.160 --> 01:53:19.160
That's right

01:53:19.820 --> 01:53:20.820
Battery Man Um

01:53:21.750 --> 01:53:24.569
Could you help me with this for a while?

01:53:24.570 --> 01:53:27.089
As soon as I see a convenience store, I
will drink some water to help you heal.

01:53:27.090 --> 01:53:29.890
No car keys.

01:53:30.190 --> 01:53:32.930
That one is here.

01:53:33.630 --> 01:53:36.740
Let's come up with a name
before the car arrives.

01:53:37.050 --> 01:53:38.450
Didn't we give it a name last time?

01:53:38.650 --> 01:53:42.030
We have a fake name but no group name.

01:53:42.240 --> 01:53:46.410
When watching a foreign movie, Super
Power Assemble, I would first name it

01:53:46.520 --> 01:53:47.930
Sister, please get up.

01:53:48.420 --> 01:53:49.789
Is it English or Korean?

01:53:49.790 --> 01:53:51.169
Sister, you decide.

01:53:51.170 --> 01:53:53.489
I'm actually good at naming.

01:53:53.490 --> 01:53:55.050
No, I'll name it.

01:53:55.740 --> 01:53:58.510
Battery man, you've worked
hard. Please charge your battery.

01:54:01.610 --> 01:54:04.550
I always feel that it would be
better to have a friendly feeling

01:54:04.870 --> 01:54:06.260
Just like saying hello

01:54:06.650 --> 01:54:08.939
Now I just thought of a suitable name

01:54:08.940 --> 01:54:11.020
Yeah, there are five of us.

01:54:11.280 --> 01:54:14.139
- Five people greet each other in English.
- Yes

01:54:14.140 --> 01:54:15.380
I know that

01:54:15.660 --> 01:54:16.780
I know what it is

01:54:17.680 --> 01:54:19.350
Uncle, please do this

01:54:20.130 --> 01:54:21.130
ah
