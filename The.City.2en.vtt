ALL CHILD ACTORS FILMED SAFELY
WITH PARENTAL SUPERVISION

00:01:41.143 --> 00:01:43.103
- I think it's her.
- You're right.

00:01:43.812 --> 00:01:44.855
Over here!

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.121
Wait.

00:02:34.196 --> 00:02:35.614
EMERGENCY ALERT

00:02:35.697 --> 00:02:36.782
What? An earthquake?

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.203
Hi, I'm Attorney Kang Huiji.

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:43.080
It's been a while.

00:02:48.085 --> 00:02:49.086
Do you know me?

00:02:50.754 --> 00:02:51.755
What?

00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:55.300
EMERGENCY ALERT

00:03:09.272 --> 00:03:10.482
Nice to meet you.

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:12.234
I'm Kim Hyungmin.

00:03:19.074 --> 00:03:20.450
Don't you remember me?

00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:26.623
You do look familiar.

00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:29.042
You seemed shocked to know her.

00:03:29.126 --> 00:03:31.837
No, the subtle tremors
were what startled me.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.463
What? You felt that?

00:03:33.547 --> 00:03:35.757
What are you, a seismometer? So lame.

00:03:35.841 --> 00:03:36.925
Please take a seat.

00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:38.927
- Okay.
- Why don't you sit here instead?

00:03:40.762 --> 00:03:42.139
- Thank you.
- Sure.

00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:43.807
Would you like a glass of beer?

00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:45.392
Yes.

00:03:51.815 --> 00:03:54.067
I was in Gwangseong Law School's
13th cohort.

00:03:54.151 --> 00:03:55.402
What? Seriously?

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.822
- Ninth cohort? I saw it on the website.
- Yes.

00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:00.782
I see! Nice to meet you.

00:04:01.783 --> 00:04:02.784
Thank you.

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:07.247
- Should we toast first?
- Great timing.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:08.707
- Cheers.
- I'm all out.

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:11.251
You should've told us earlier then.

00:04:13.295 --> 00:04:14.379
Have some of mine.

00:04:21.553 --> 00:04:22.888
All right, then. Cheers!

00:04:22.971 --> 00:04:24.306
- Cheers!
- Nice to meet you!

00:04:34.941 --> 00:04:38.445
So, how do you know Juhyeong?

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.490
We were briefly together before.

00:04:46.453 --> 00:04:47.621
- Here.
- Thank you.

00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:50.749
You crazy bastard.
You forgot someone you dated?

00:04:50.832 --> 00:04:52.751
What are you talking about?
We never dated.

00:04:52.834 --> 00:04:55.420
When did I say we dated?
I said we were together.

00:04:56.087 --> 00:04:58.799
We were both briefly in Hong Kong and met.

00:04:59.382 --> 00:05:01.635
Gosh, you should've said that then.

00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:03.678
He said he doesn't remember anyways.

00:05:05.764 --> 00:05:07.015
Wait, Hong Kong?

00:05:07.098 --> 00:05:08.391
When you went two years ago?

00:05:08.475 --> 00:05:11.770
Honestly, if it was two years ago,
you should be able to remember that.

00:05:12.521 --> 00:05:14.564
Someone this pretty
would be hard to forget.

00:05:14.648 --> 00:05:15.982
Exactly.

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.780
This is the first time we've met.

00:05:22.364 --> 00:05:25.116
I only saw your name
when I signed the lease agreement.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.620
Right. I usually leave property matters
to the building manager.

00:05:29.412 --> 00:05:31.706
I'm probably new to all of you,

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.960
but I've made sure to learn
who each of you are.

00:05:36.002 --> 00:05:37.254
So you all seem familiar.

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:40.006
Us?

00:05:40.757 --> 00:05:43.134
You're the tenants in my building.

00:05:43.218 --> 00:05:45.637
To me, you're my clients.

00:05:46.972 --> 00:05:49.850
I think this is our first time
meeting like this as well.

00:05:49.933 --> 00:05:54.479
Well, we've crossed paths before,
but we've never introduced ourselves.

00:05:55.438 --> 00:05:58.066
We've introduced ourselves.
Right, Director Seong?

00:06:00.151 --> 00:06:01.695
Yes, we have.

00:06:02.654 --> 00:06:05.282
It was because of
Attorney Ha Sanggi, right?

00:06:06.157 --> 00:06:08.660
He used to work for Mr. Seong.

00:06:08.743 --> 00:06:12.080
And then, he switched
to Ms. Kim's firm upstairs.

00:06:12.664 --> 00:06:13.999
That's right!

00:06:14.082 --> 00:06:16.418
With someone as beautiful as her,

00:06:16.501 --> 00:06:19.045
you should remember
if it was just two years ago.

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:21.381
- Wait, wasn't that around then?
- You're right.

00:06:24.092 --> 00:06:25.468
What? What is it?

00:06:25.552 --> 00:06:27.679
Well, the reason why
he went to Hong Kong was…

00:06:29.598 --> 00:06:31.516
Hey, what was her name again?

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:34.728
The blind date.

00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:39.107
Diamond Kim! Right?

00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:42.777
- Thank you.
- Crystal Park. Park Sujeong.

00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:46.573
Right. Crystal Park is his ex-girlfriend.

00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:48.450
After they broke up, he was a mess.

00:06:48.533 --> 00:06:50.577
We told him to take a trip
and he went there.

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.204
Her name was Sujeong,
so we nicknamed her Crystal Park.

00:06:53.288 --> 00:06:55.040
How did he turn that into Diamond Kim?

00:06:55.123 --> 00:06:59.002
Hey! Diamond Kim, Crystal Park.
It's all the same in Korean.

00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:02.255
They're totally different.
Crystal is sujeong.

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:05.008
And diamond is… What was it again?

00:07:05.634 --> 00:07:08.386
- Geum gangseok.
- Thank you. Yeah, geum gangseok.

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:11.264
So you're saying Juhyeong's ex
was Kim Geum Gangseok?

00:07:11.348 --> 00:07:14.768
I mean, Kim and geum
basically sound the same in Korean.

00:07:14.851 --> 00:07:16.853
So it could've been Kim Gangseok.

00:07:16.936 --> 00:07:18.104
Kim Gangseok?

00:07:18.688 --> 00:07:20.482
What, did she sing
A Letter from a Private?

00:07:20.565 --> 00:07:21.733
That's Kim Gwangseok.

00:07:21.816 --> 00:07:23.318
I know that.

00:07:26.821 --> 00:07:29.407
Did you just say her name
in front of my face?

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.995
Were we still
not supposed to say her name?

00:07:34.079 --> 00:07:36.623
No, you said it wrong anyway,
so you're fine.

00:07:36.706 --> 00:07:39.542
But seriously,
Diamond Kim was a bit ridiculous.

00:07:39.626 --> 00:07:43.421
Right? Hey, Munjeong! I can't believe you.

00:07:43.505 --> 00:07:45.298
How could you say her name so clearly?

00:07:45.382 --> 00:07:47.300
Hey, this was your fault.

00:07:47.384 --> 00:07:49.636
Yeah. This was your fault, Munjeong.

00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:51.012
Are you serious?

00:07:51.513 --> 00:07:52.639
You all brought it up…

00:07:54.724 --> 00:07:56.101
What?

00:07:56.184 --> 00:07:58.603
It's been over two years.
I can't even say her name?

00:07:58.687 --> 00:08:01.439
Yeah. You don't even recall
Attorney Kang from two years ago.

00:08:01.523 --> 00:08:03.108
No, we didn't meet then.

00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:06.820
- It was 10 years ago, not two.
- What?

00:08:06.903 --> 00:08:08.363
- What?
- 10 years ago?

00:08:09.072 --> 00:08:11.324
You keep saving
the important bits for last.

00:08:11.408 --> 00:08:12.909
Are you a storyteller or what?

00:08:14.244 --> 00:08:17.247
Right. You went to Hong Kong
while in law school too.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.917
Juhyeong was a law student,
and I was still an undergrad.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:25.505
You even said
we should meet up again in Korea.

00:08:25.588 --> 00:08:26.589
I said what?

00:08:27.173 --> 00:08:29.968
My gosh! You two were a thing!

00:08:30.051 --> 00:08:31.928
- You were a thing!
- What is this?

00:08:32.011 --> 00:08:34.055
I didn't know you had
such skills back then.

00:08:34.139 --> 00:08:36.474
In any case, who cares?
He doesn't even remember.

00:08:37.892 --> 00:08:41.312
So, how was Hong Kong?

00:08:41.396 --> 00:08:42.897
It was so beautiful back then.

00:08:46.693 --> 00:08:48.153
Which part?

00:08:49.112 --> 00:08:50.238
Hey, which part?

00:08:55.994 --> 00:08:59.539
But are you sure
we actually agreed to meet again?

00:08:59.622 --> 00:09:01.458
Geez. And here I thought he'd remembered.

00:09:01.541 --> 00:09:03.752
I mean, it's just not true.
You think I'd say that?

00:09:03.835 --> 00:09:06.546
- You did.
- You said you didn't even remember.

00:09:06.629 --> 00:09:08.089
Or maybe he does remember.

00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:13.845
No, I don't. It's because
I would've never said that.

00:09:16.056 --> 00:09:17.182
Don't worry about it.

00:09:17.265 --> 00:09:18.641
Want me to get you another glass?

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:21.227
Then, could I have some soju?

00:09:21.311 --> 00:09:23.605
Beer upsets my stomach a bit.

00:09:23.688 --> 00:09:25.857
Goodness, you should've said so earlier!

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.526
- One soju, please!
- Thank you.

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:33.907
- Still, we just met and you offered.
- Come on! I'll take that formality and…

00:09:35.116 --> 00:09:37.368
I threw it out. Okay?
No need to be so formal.

00:09:37.452 --> 00:09:39.162
- You can relax.
- I will.

00:09:40.622 --> 00:09:42.791
So I guess you threw away
your beer on me then.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.085
What?

00:09:45.168 --> 00:09:47.462
- What's wrong with you?
- It's true.

00:09:47.545 --> 00:09:49.547
Gosh, don't take it that way.

00:09:49.631 --> 00:09:51.883
Your glass was empty, so I shared mine.

00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:54.260
Come on. We go back 10 years.

00:09:54.344 --> 00:09:56.221
Ten years? Says who?

00:10:03.186 --> 00:10:06.523
But what did you want to meet about today?

00:10:06.606 --> 00:10:09.818
Isn't this just about
getting to know each other?

00:10:09.901 --> 00:10:11.986
Is this just a casual get-together?

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:13.822
No, not exactly.

00:10:15.448 --> 00:10:17.325
Since you're all busy people,

00:10:18.118 --> 00:10:19.661
let's get straight to the point.

00:10:19.744 --> 00:10:21.538
Yes, please.

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:23.164
Your law firms

00:10:24.415 --> 00:10:25.416
and law office…

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:28.837
Let's merge them into one.

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:45.145
- I take Line 2 on the subway.
- What? Me too.

00:10:45.228 --> 00:10:47.063
- Which way?
- I go toward Jamsil too.

00:10:47.147 --> 00:10:48.356
We're this way. You?

00:10:48.439 --> 00:10:49.691
- Okay.
- That way?

00:10:49.774 --> 00:10:51.943
- Yes.
- See you next time!

00:10:52.026 --> 00:10:53.027
- Bye!
- Good night.

00:10:55.488 --> 00:10:56.489
Which way are you going?

00:10:57.157 --> 00:10:58.199
- Bye.
- Okay, bye.

00:11:03.037 --> 00:11:05.415
It still seems
to bother Juhyeong, doesn't it?

00:11:05.498 --> 00:11:06.499
Yeah.

00:11:06.583 --> 00:11:08.751
I figured it was okay
to talk about her now,

00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:10.545
so I tossed it out there.

00:11:10.628 --> 00:11:12.005
But I guess not.

00:11:12.088 --> 00:11:14.591
I didn't expect that at all
from someone who seems so chill.

00:11:14.674 --> 00:11:15.675
Right?

00:11:17.218 --> 00:11:20.346
Hey, doesn't Attorney Kang
seem like a good person?

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:22.765
Yeah, she's super friendly.

00:11:23.474 --> 00:11:25.560
I almost snapped at her
earlier by accident.

00:12:09.729 --> 00:12:12.690
- You're getting in just now?
- Yes, you're still up?

00:12:12.774 --> 00:12:14.025
I woke up in the middle.

00:12:14.108 --> 00:12:17.070
- What about dinner?
- I had dinner with my friends.

00:12:17.153 --> 00:12:18.154
Okay, get some rest.

00:12:18.238 --> 00:12:19.572
- Okay, good night.
- All right.

00:12:31.125 --> 00:12:32.669
He doesn't remember me?

00:12:40.635 --> 00:12:44.138
I mean, how could you forget
someone this cute?

00:12:49.852 --> 00:12:50.853
SUPREME COURT UPDATE

00:12:51.771 --> 00:12:53.439
A new precedent.

00:12:54.107 --> 00:12:55.108
Let's have a look.

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:20.675
Ten years, my foot.

00:13:22.593 --> 00:13:26.556
COURT, PROSECUTION OFFICE,
REGISTRATION BUREAU

00:13:32.228 --> 00:13:35.315
Episode 2 More Than Meets the Eye

00:13:40.653 --> 00:13:42.447
{\an8}It's not much, but please enjoy.

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:45.950
{\an8}Gosh, you didn't have to!
Thank you. I am in your debt.

00:13:46.034 --> 00:13:48.828
{\an8}I should be the one saying that.
I'm the new one here.

00:13:49.454 --> 00:13:51.622
{\an8}I didn't even know you were a lawyer.

00:13:51.706 --> 00:13:53.791
{\an8}You look as young as a student!

00:13:53.875 --> 00:13:55.793
{\an8}What kind of student looks like this?

00:13:55.877 --> 00:13:56.878
{\an8}ATTORNEY AHN JUHYEONG

00:14:11.642 --> 00:14:12.727
Attorney Ahn?

00:14:13.561 --> 00:14:15.688
Attorney Kang told me to give this to you.

00:14:15.772 --> 00:14:18.524
She wanted to thank us
getting together for her.

00:14:18.608 --> 00:14:20.276
It wasn't for her though.

00:14:20.359 --> 00:14:23.029
Come on, it was. What do you mean?

00:14:24.113 --> 00:14:25.656
I don't drink coffee.

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:28.367
How would Attorney Kang even know that?

00:14:29.535 --> 00:14:30.620
Just take it, will you?

00:14:37.627 --> 00:14:39.796
If you don't want it, fine. More for me.

00:14:51.474 --> 00:14:54.143
That's why I'm asking you for help.

00:14:54.936 --> 00:14:57.855
Originally, you only wanted us
to draft the seizure request,

00:14:57.939 --> 00:15:00.066
so we gave you a discounted rate.

00:15:00.149 --> 00:15:04.070
And I'm going with you free of charge
because I understand your situation.

00:15:05.113 --> 00:15:06.739
I'm also aware, but…

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:08.991
- What's going on?
- I wouldn't be asking

00:15:09.075 --> 00:15:11.994
- if I wasn't so desperate!
- Tomorrow's the asset seizure.

00:15:12.078 --> 00:15:14.997
They're going to force open the door
and start tagging items,

00:15:15.081 --> 00:15:17.208
so he wants a lawyer to come along too.

00:15:17.959 --> 00:15:20.670
- There's really no way?
- I understand your situation,

00:15:20.753 --> 00:15:21.921
but we really can't.

00:15:23.714 --> 00:15:24.715
All right, then.

00:15:27.885 --> 00:15:28.970
I'll see you tomorrow.

00:15:35.852 --> 00:15:38.604
Mr. Eom, are you going
to the asset seizure tomorrow?

00:15:38.688 --> 00:15:41.065
Yes. You don't have to worry about it.

00:15:41.941 --> 00:15:43.568
What kind of person is the debtor?

00:15:45.278 --> 00:15:48.322
He runs a business.
It's a classic dine and dash.

00:15:48.406 --> 00:15:50.074
The lender's the real victim.

00:15:50.158 --> 00:15:51.951
It seems he lent his whole fortune.

00:16:00.209 --> 00:16:02.336
You're going
to the asset seizure tomorrow?

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:05.798
Yes, I do feel bad for the lender,
but I'm also curious.

00:16:06.924 --> 00:16:09.302
You're going to see some ugly stuff.

00:16:09.385 --> 00:16:13.222
Debtors who are cornered tend to lash out.

00:16:13.306 --> 00:16:16.392
Don't go. What for?
You'll just come across trouble.

00:16:16.475 --> 00:16:18.936
No, it's okay.
Word is, the debtor's actually loaded.

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:22.773
But he's hidden all his assets,
so they have no choice but to seize them.

00:16:22.857 --> 00:16:25.109
Rich people aren't easy to deal with.

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:28.362
- Wait! He hasn't taken a picture yet.
- I did.

00:16:28.446 --> 00:16:30.031
- What? When?
- Earlier.

00:16:30.114 --> 00:16:31.407
He's fast now.

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:33.701
Hold on! It's not ready yet.

00:16:37.163 --> 00:16:38.748
But if you just started yesterday,

00:16:38.831 --> 00:16:41.751
you should be swamped with looking
at your own case files right now.

00:16:41.834 --> 00:16:43.794
Do you have time to tag along
on some other case

00:16:43.878 --> 00:16:45.838
just because you feel for them
and are curious?

00:16:45.922 --> 00:16:46.964
You're only a first-year.

00:16:47.048 --> 00:16:49.217
Yes, I've already reviewed
all my case files.

00:16:50.635 --> 00:16:51.802
All of them?

00:16:51.886 --> 00:16:54.513
Yes, but as I looked through,
a few parts were confusing.

00:16:54.597 --> 00:16:57.683
- Can I ask you about them later?
- Why would you ask me?

00:16:57.767 --> 00:17:00.269
That's what it said on the handover file.

00:17:00.353 --> 00:17:02.313
It said to ask you about difficult cases.

00:17:02.396 --> 00:17:03.731
- What?
- Wait.

00:17:03.814 --> 00:17:06.234
That was in the handover file?

00:17:06.317 --> 00:17:10.571
Yes. "Ask Ahn Juhyeong
for difficult cases."

00:17:10.655 --> 00:17:12.698
"For good restaurants, ask Bae Munjeong."

00:17:12.782 --> 00:17:15.576
And it said to ask Ha Sanggi
for savings accounts,

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.662
retirement plans, and tax deductions.

00:17:19.121 --> 00:17:22.833
It turns out Mr. Yu
was more calculating than I thought.

00:17:22.917 --> 00:17:26.754
Look at him.
He's already calling his friend "Mr. Yu."

00:17:26.837 --> 00:17:29.507
Well, what about me?

00:17:31.634 --> 00:17:32.635
You were…

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:35.930
I guess there was nothing.

00:17:36.514 --> 00:17:37.765
Yes.

00:17:37.848 --> 00:17:40.101
I was the closest to him though.

00:17:41.644 --> 00:17:46.023
I brought it along just in case.
They're notes my predecessor wrote.

00:17:46.107 --> 00:17:49.151
- I don't understand the part he marked.
- Let me see.

00:17:51.529 --> 00:17:53.906
Gosh, look at these insane indents.

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:55.992
I know.
That firm always formats like that.

00:17:56.075 --> 00:17:57.952
- Hey, Juhyeong…
- I'm in a hurry.

00:17:58.035 --> 00:18:00.413
- I have to…
- Just wait a second!

00:18:00.496 --> 00:18:01.831
I'm busy this afternoon too.

00:18:02.582 --> 00:18:03.708
Geez.

00:18:06.168 --> 00:18:07.169
It's ready.

00:18:07.962 --> 00:18:10.464
Eat up.
Ask him after we're done eating.

00:18:10.548 --> 00:18:12.675
- Okay.
- I want some meat.

00:18:12.758 --> 00:18:14.093
- That's good.
- Here you go.

00:18:14.719 --> 00:18:16.387
What are you consulting on, Juhyeong?

00:18:18.222 --> 00:18:20.099
It's related to an eviction lawsuit.

00:18:20.182 --> 00:18:23.311
A real estate transfer claim
through the creditor's subrogation right.

00:18:24.061 --> 00:18:25.771
What? What lawsuit?

00:18:25.855 --> 00:18:28.065
It's a lawsuit to evict someone
for not paying debts.

00:18:28.149 --> 00:18:29.609
You made it sound too fancy.

00:18:29.692 --> 00:18:31.277
Did you do that to intimidate her?

00:18:32.236 --> 00:18:35.364
It's the same as mine.
Tracking someone down over unpaid loans.

00:18:36.198 --> 00:18:39.744
It's totally different. I file lawsuits
and don't chase people to their homes.

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.247
Hey, hurry and eat.
You said you were busy.

00:18:47.293 --> 00:18:48.753
Cooking it longer was a good idea.

00:18:48.836 --> 00:18:51.297
- The flavor needs to infuse in the tofu.
- It's really good.

00:18:54.216 --> 00:18:55.926
I'd be better if it simmered a bit more.

00:19:09.815 --> 00:19:11.192
I forgot my phone!

00:19:14.445 --> 00:19:15.488
Goodness.

00:19:27.291 --> 00:19:28.834
- Bye.
- See you.

00:19:32.713 --> 00:19:33.798
Later.

00:19:40.096 --> 00:19:42.223
I think you might be
misremembering things.

00:19:44.141 --> 00:19:47.103
- About what?
- We never made plans to meet in Seoul.

00:19:47.186 --> 00:19:48.354
That wouldn't have happened.

00:19:51.023 --> 00:19:52.692
Try to think carefully again.

00:20:08.541 --> 00:20:11.252
That's what all the attitude was about?

00:20:18.008 --> 00:20:21.429
I believe I'm remembering it correctly.

00:20:21.512 --> 00:20:23.055
This is kind of ridiculous.

00:20:26.809 --> 00:20:28.102
ATTORNEY AHN JUHYEONG

00:20:30.104 --> 00:20:31.105
Okay.

00:20:32.648 --> 00:20:34.108
Is he insane?

00:20:45.077 --> 00:20:50.249
IS HE INSANE?

00:20:53.043 --> 00:20:55.463
- Huiji, do you have a minute?
- Yes, ma'am.

00:20:55.546 --> 00:20:57.548
Can you sit in on a consult for me?

00:20:58.174 --> 00:20:59.175
Sure.

00:21:11.479 --> 00:21:14.148
Mr. Jang Hyeonseok!

00:21:16.567 --> 00:21:17.985
I said no one by that name's here.

00:21:18.068 --> 00:21:20.863
Are you sure he's not in there?
It's the right address.

00:21:20.946 --> 00:21:22.782
Yes, it is.

00:21:22.865 --> 00:21:24.867
But no one by that name lives here,
so leave.

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:26.035
We were here two days ago!

00:21:26.619 --> 00:21:29.663
Look, we have documents
showing he lives here.

00:21:29.747 --> 00:21:33.918
There's a court order to vacate,
and we have to enforce it today.

00:21:34.001 --> 00:21:35.795
It makes no sense that he's suddenly gone.

00:21:35.878 --> 00:21:38.255
Either way, they're not here.

00:21:38.339 --> 00:21:40.132
So leave. Get out!

00:21:40.216 --> 00:21:41.342
How many times do I…

00:21:41.425 --> 00:21:42.676
Is he really not here?

00:21:43.219 --> 00:21:44.887
- I need the restroom.
- Are you insane?

00:21:47.056 --> 00:21:48.432
Get out!

00:21:56.941 --> 00:21:57.983
Thank you so much.

00:21:59.401 --> 00:22:01.862
I agreed to help
because of your circumstances,

00:22:01.946 --> 00:22:03.197
but I can't do it next time.

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.115
No, I should be the one apologizing.

00:22:05.199 --> 00:22:06.200
Gosh.

00:22:07.117 --> 00:22:09.119
Hey, hang in there.

00:22:09.703 --> 00:22:10.704
Okay.

00:22:11.455 --> 00:22:12.540
Thank you.

00:22:20.548 --> 00:22:22.800
NEIGHBORLY SAVINGS BANK
KIM JAEWAN

00:22:22.883 --> 00:22:26.011
Yes, I heard the eviction order
didn't go through today.

00:22:26.095 --> 00:22:28.597
No. We went, but some stranger
answered and claimed

00:22:28.681 --> 00:22:30.349
Jang Hyeonseok didn't live there.

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:35.813
{\an8}Let's consider a provisional injunction
to block transfer of occupancy.

00:22:35.896 --> 00:22:38.274
First, look at this
since that's what you came for.

00:22:38.357 --> 00:22:39.400
Okay.

00:22:39.984 --> 00:22:42.736
Mr. Na told me you wanted to hear
the explanation again

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:44.905
before the hearing date.

00:22:44.989 --> 00:22:47.992
Yes. I'm still unclear on a few parts.

00:22:48.075 --> 00:22:52.705
Right. We did go over it once by phone
before the complaint was filed.

00:22:52.788 --> 00:22:55.082
Basically, you loaned him money, right?

00:22:55.666 --> 00:22:58.335
Yes, he said he needed it
for a lease deposit.

00:22:58.419 --> 00:23:01.338
Right, but he hasn't paid back
the principal or the interest?

00:23:02.214 --> 00:23:04.049
- That's right.
- So as collateral,

00:23:04.133 --> 00:23:05.885
the lease deposit was transferred to you?

00:23:05.968 --> 00:23:07.511
- Yes.
- Okay.

00:23:08.095 --> 00:23:11.807
In this case, the debtor's lease
should have ended first.

00:23:11.891 --> 00:23:14.810
But since we acquired
the lease deposit claim,

00:23:14.894 --> 00:23:17.313
they can't oppose us
with a renewed contract.

00:23:17.396 --> 00:23:19.356
The original lease term has ended now,

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.191
so the contract is considered terminated.

00:23:21.275 --> 00:23:22.818
But that doesn't mean

00:23:22.902 --> 00:23:25.821
the landlord is required
to give back the deposit to us.

00:23:25.905 --> 00:23:27.489
The debtor must hand over

00:23:27.573 --> 00:23:29.825
the rental property to the landlord first

00:23:29.909 --> 00:23:32.077
before the deposit can be returned.

00:23:32.161 --> 00:23:33.704
Since that isn't happening,

00:23:33.787 --> 00:23:36.874
we're exercising
our subrogation right as the creditor

00:23:36.957 --> 00:23:39.001
to forcibly claim the property.

00:23:39.919 --> 00:23:41.086
That's the lawsuit.

00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:47.051
Right.

00:23:50.054 --> 00:23:51.055
Okay.

00:23:54.391 --> 00:23:56.602
This is us. And this is the debtor.

00:23:56.685 --> 00:23:59.188
That's the landlord of the debtor's home.

00:24:00.105 --> 00:24:02.399
- Who's this again?
- Us?

00:24:02.483 --> 00:24:03.859
- The debtor.
- The debtor.

00:24:03.943 --> 00:24:06.987
DEPOSIT

00:24:09.031 --> 00:24:12.493
Now, once you move out,

00:24:12.576 --> 00:24:15.829
the public housing corporation
can return the deposit to the bank.

00:24:15.913 --> 00:24:18.791
The bank is evicting you
to get the deposit back.

00:24:18.874 --> 00:24:19.959
Does that make sense?

00:24:21.126 --> 00:24:22.127
Yes.

00:24:23.379 --> 00:24:26.006
Since it's true
that you haven't paid the bank back,

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:28.217
so legally,
it's hard to block the lawsuit.

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:32.471
Then, does that mean
I'll just get kicked out of my house?

00:24:32.554 --> 00:24:36.767
You should still fight it somehow.
At least try to buy yourself some time.

00:24:38.018 --> 00:24:39.770
But the trial's tomorrow.

00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:44.108
It seems cases like these
are common nowadays.

00:24:44.191 --> 00:24:46.360
I heard about a similar one earlier today.

00:24:46.443 --> 00:24:49.071
I heard the lawyer's office for the bank
was in this building,

00:24:49.154 --> 00:24:52.199
so I came to try and plead with them.

00:24:52.908 --> 00:24:56.537
I didn't even get to see their lawyer.
They turned me away at the door.

00:24:57.204 --> 00:25:00.791
I'm grasping at straws,
so I came up here.

00:25:03.168 --> 00:25:04.169
The floor below us?

00:25:05.129 --> 00:25:07.673
Do you know the lawyers downstairs?

00:25:07.756 --> 00:25:10.300
{\an8}COMPLAINT FILED BY LAW GROUP KYUNGMIN
ATTORNEYS NA, AHN

00:25:10.384 --> 00:25:12.344
{\an8}What are you consulting on, Juhyeong?

00:25:12.428 --> 00:25:14.430
It's related to an eviction lawsuit.

00:25:14.513 --> 00:25:17.516
A real estate transfer claim
through the creditor's subrogation right.

00:25:17.599 --> 00:25:19.852
It's a lawsuit to evict someone
for not paying debts.

00:25:21.687 --> 00:25:26.525
If you're close to them,
could you ask them to drop the case?

00:25:28.652 --> 00:25:31.530
The lawyers downstairs
are just doing their job

00:25:31.613 --> 00:25:33.240
on behalf of the bank.

00:25:33.323 --> 00:25:37.786
It's not my place to ask them to drop it.
It wouldn't be proper.

00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:39.788
Right, of course.

00:25:39.872 --> 00:25:44.585
Then, don't you take on
any pro bono cases?

00:25:44.668 --> 00:25:46.253
I know it's shameless of me to ask.

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:49.965
I'll ask my director and get back to you.

00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:52.342
- Thank you.
- No problem at all.

00:25:56.555 --> 00:25:59.850
{\an8}I used to take pro bono cases
because I wanted to help.

00:25:59.933 --> 00:26:01.935
But once word got out,

00:26:02.019 --> 00:26:04.563
everyone started showing up
asking for free help.

00:26:04.646 --> 00:26:05.731
So I stopped.

00:26:06.899 --> 00:26:08.776
I can see that.

00:26:10.611 --> 00:26:13.363
I do feel for him.

00:26:14.698 --> 00:26:15.949
But I'm afraid I can't.

00:26:25.417 --> 00:26:27.795
All that fancy talk,

00:26:29.338 --> 00:26:32.424
but he's just kicking people out
of public housing while acting cool.

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:36.553
COMPLAINT

00:26:43.143 --> 00:26:44.436
Don't we need an appointment?

00:26:45.437 --> 00:26:48.357
Don't places like this
usually take walk-ins?

00:26:50.943 --> 00:26:52.569
There are so many law offices here.

00:26:53.487 --> 00:26:56.073
How do we know where to go for counseling?

00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:59.868
- There's too many to choose from.
- Should we try every floor?

00:26:59.952 --> 00:27:01.745
- Let's skip the 6th floor.
- Why?

00:27:01.829 --> 00:27:04.414
That one's a law office, not a law firm.

00:27:04.498 --> 00:27:08.710
- Is there a difference?
- Doesn't it feel like a smaller operation?

00:27:29.147 --> 00:27:30.190
Sixth floor…

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:53.881
A merger?

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:58.760
Some of you run law firms,

00:27:58.844 --> 00:28:01.138
and others run law offices.

00:28:01.221 --> 00:28:06.101
But don't most people prefer
to run a law firm if they could?

00:28:06.184 --> 00:28:08.812
Law offices aren't necessarily lesser.

00:28:08.896 --> 00:28:11.106
I'm well aware of that.

00:28:11.189 --> 00:28:14.151
But do regular folks see it that way?

00:28:14.776 --> 00:28:15.819
Probably not.

00:28:17.154 --> 00:28:19.031
- Attorney Ahn, are you busy?
- Yes.

00:28:19.948 --> 00:28:23.327
Attorney Kim Geoncheol left,

00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:25.662
so you know we have
an open partner spot, right?

00:28:25.746 --> 00:28:28.373
- Yes, I'm aware.
- Any thoughts of taking that spot?

00:28:28.457 --> 00:28:32.252
- All of a sudden?
- Come on. You've been at it for 10 years.

00:28:33.337 --> 00:28:36.173
Sir, don't keep adding a year
every time you bring it up.

00:28:36.256 --> 00:28:38.508
It's been eight years
since I passed probation

00:28:38.592 --> 00:28:40.719
and nine if you're counting by calendar.

00:28:40.802 --> 00:28:42.721
Either way, you're due to go solo.

00:28:42.804 --> 00:28:44.389
- Yes, well…
- Who stays an associate

00:28:44.473 --> 00:28:45.849
this long in Seocho-dong?

00:28:45.933 --> 00:28:48.060
No, I have no thoughts
about that right now.

00:28:48.143 --> 00:28:51.980
A few years ago, you talked about
starting your own practice with me.

00:28:52.064 --> 00:28:54.483
No, I like where I'm at now.

00:29:01.365 --> 00:29:02.407
Really?

00:29:03.075 --> 00:29:05.243
- Okay, don't worry about it.
- Okay.

00:29:10.749 --> 00:29:14.169
But we're not a law office.
We're already a law firm.

00:29:14.252 --> 00:29:15.796
So why should we do this?

00:29:15.879 --> 00:29:18.757
You currently have
only two registered partners now, right?

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:20.801
Since Attorney Kim left?

00:29:21.468 --> 00:29:24.429
You need at least three,
excluding associates.

00:29:24.513 --> 00:29:27.224
We're planning to bring someone in soon.

00:29:27.307 --> 00:29:30.435
If your firm stays non-compliant
for a few more months,

00:29:30.519 --> 00:29:32.938
you'll end up paying back a ton in taxes.

00:29:34.439 --> 00:29:35.440
ATTORNEY KANG HUIJI

00:29:37.901 --> 00:29:39.903
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hi.

00:29:43.365 --> 00:29:45.367
She's coming
to the asset seizure tomorrow.

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:46.910
She's really dedicated.

00:29:47.494 --> 00:29:49.496
Right? I think we made a good hire.

00:29:50.872 --> 00:29:53.500
I had a great feeling about her
during the interview.

00:29:54.126 --> 00:29:55.711
She's very eager to learn too.

00:29:57.045 --> 00:30:00.132
You were so worried
since we only had one resume come in.

00:30:00.215 --> 00:30:02.926
Exactly. We rarely get applicants.

00:30:10.017 --> 00:30:14.688
I hope she doesn't leave soon
for some bigger firm though.

00:30:14.771 --> 00:30:16.356
No, I don't think she will.

00:30:21.194 --> 00:30:24.156
You're saying we should ditch
our current independent partners

00:30:24.239 --> 00:30:28.285
and only merge
with the managing partners here?

00:30:28.368 --> 00:30:33.081
If we ditch them, we'd lose headcount.
There'd be no point in merging.

00:30:33.165 --> 00:30:35.834
You'd need to grow in numbers
for it to mean something.

00:30:36.418 --> 00:30:38.503
With more lawyers,
the firm will look bigger.

00:30:38.587 --> 00:30:40.630
And that would help with both business

00:30:41.465 --> 00:30:42.716
and recruitment.

00:30:43.717 --> 00:30:44.885
Ms. Kang,

00:30:45.469 --> 00:30:48.305
it seemed like
finding that new hire wasn't easy.

00:30:49.598 --> 00:30:50.974
LAW GROUP CHUNGGONG

00:30:52.225 --> 00:30:53.393
- Ms. Kim.
- Yes?

00:30:53.477 --> 00:30:55.645
I need more business cards.
Could you order them?

00:30:55.729 --> 00:30:57.564
- Sure.
- Ms. Kim, hold on.

00:30:57.647 --> 00:30:58.690
What's the matter, sir?

00:30:58.774 --> 00:31:00.442
Put a hold on ordering those for now.

00:31:00.525 --> 00:31:01.526
Sorry?

00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:04.738
- But I only have about 20 left.
- Just wait a bit, all right?

00:31:04.821 --> 00:31:07.824
You don't even use them.
Do you use them for something else?

00:31:07.908 --> 00:31:11.369
- No, it's not like that.
- Exactly, so just hold off.

00:31:11.453 --> 00:31:13.663
If the boss says so,
there's always a reason.

00:31:13.747 --> 00:31:14.998
It's for business reasons.

00:31:15.916 --> 00:31:17.626
It's not like you scout clients.

00:31:17.709 --> 00:31:19.002
Yes, sir. I understand.

00:31:19.086 --> 00:31:20.670
No new cards. Okay?

00:31:22.214 --> 00:31:23.381
Gosh.

00:31:24.674 --> 00:31:25.759
Thank you.

00:31:28.386 --> 00:31:32.307

{\an8}LAW GROUP CHUNGGONG
MANAGING PARTNER SEONG YUDEOK

00:31:38.021 --> 00:31:41.525
{\an8}Hyungmin Building's Law Group…

00:31:42.567 --> 00:31:43.610
Hyungmin.

00:31:44.569 --> 00:31:46.238
Law Group Hyungmin.

00:31:46.321 --> 00:31:48.156
That will be the name of the merged firm.

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:53.078
Well, you've already picked a name?
I have no thoughts of joining though.

00:31:53.161 --> 00:31:54.788
If you merge,

00:31:54.871 --> 00:31:58.792
you'll get the top four floors
of our eight-floor building.

00:31:59.876 --> 00:32:02.546
A single law firm taking up
half the building with a name

00:32:02.629 --> 00:32:04.339
that matches the building's?

00:32:05.257 --> 00:32:07.050
It looks way more impressive, right?

00:32:07.759 --> 00:32:09.928
It'll look like the firm
owns the building.

00:32:10.679 --> 00:32:11.680
It'll be beneficial.

00:32:17.018 --> 00:32:20.772
Hyungmin Building's Law Group Hyungmin.

00:32:20.856 --> 00:32:23.650
Law Group Hyungmin in Hyungmin Building.

00:32:24.234 --> 00:32:26.319
It'll look great even on a business card.

00:32:27.195 --> 00:32:30.031
Law Group Hyungmin,
located in Hyungmin Building.

00:32:30.115 --> 00:32:32.784
What do you think?
It would help with business.

00:32:32.868 --> 00:32:34.494
- Right, Director Seong?
- I like it.

00:32:35.162 --> 00:32:36.454
It's nice.

00:32:37.247 --> 00:32:39.332
- Right? I like it.
- You already operate separately.

00:32:39.416 --> 00:32:40.584
So even if you merge,

00:32:40.667 --> 00:32:43.336
you'll still keep
your own clients and profits.

00:32:43.879 --> 00:32:46.256
Nothing really changes.

00:32:46.339 --> 00:32:49.092
Except now, you look like a major firm.

00:32:49.176 --> 00:32:51.261
I can't see why you'd say no.

00:32:52.888 --> 00:32:55.515
Gosh, Ms. Kim.

00:32:55.599 --> 00:32:58.143
You seem to know everything
about this field.

00:32:58.226 --> 00:32:59.603
Are you a former lawyer?

00:33:02.606 --> 00:33:05.483
I've spent my fair share of time
in Seocho-dong.

00:33:07.277 --> 00:33:10.655
Let's assume we have no reason
to turn it down.

00:33:11.323 --> 00:33:14.659
But what would you get out of this?

00:33:17.746 --> 00:33:20.248
Me? Nothing really.

00:33:20.832 --> 00:33:23.418
Then, I won't accept the offer.

00:33:23.501 --> 00:33:24.711
Because I don't benefit?

00:33:24.794 --> 00:33:27.380
There's no such thing as a deal
with zero upside.

00:33:27.464 --> 00:33:29.257
Saying you have nothing to gain

00:33:29.341 --> 00:33:32.177
just sounds like
you have something to hide from us.

00:33:34.971 --> 00:33:37.641
You're lawyers through and through.

00:33:38.558 --> 00:33:39.809
All right.

00:33:40.644 --> 00:33:42.062
Here's the truth.

00:33:43.355 --> 00:33:47.484
If your firms merge
and share the same name as the building's,

00:33:49.027 --> 00:33:51.404
it'll be harder for you to move out.

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:58.828
I want to maintain
stable, long-term tenants.

00:33:58.912 --> 00:34:01.665
So does that sound convincing enough?

00:34:01.748 --> 00:34:03.917
Even with all of that,

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.920
if one of us wanted to
move somewhere else,

00:34:07.003 --> 00:34:10.674
it wouldn't be impossible to open a branch

00:34:10.757 --> 00:34:12.550
under the same name.

00:34:12.634 --> 00:34:16.721
Well, it's not impossible,
but I'm sure it'd be a pain.

00:34:16.805 --> 00:34:19.599
Make it easy to enter and hard to leave.

00:34:20.183 --> 00:34:21.726
That's basic business.

00:34:22.269 --> 00:34:23.687
And one more thing.

00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:27.482
If you do merge,
I might throw a few cases your way.

00:34:27.565 --> 00:34:28.817
Maybe often.

00:34:29.526 --> 00:34:32.028
I always have a lot of lawsuits
going on around me.

00:34:34.656 --> 00:34:36.950
What do you say? Would you like to merge?

00:34:38.827 --> 00:34:41.162
ORDER AND GROUNDS

MANAGING PARTNER KANG JEONGYUN

00:35:16.781 --> 00:35:17.782
This is Kim Hyungmin.

00:35:18.491 --> 00:35:20.118
By 9:00 a.m. tomorrow morning,

00:35:20.201 --> 00:35:22.746
please let me know your decision
regarding the merger.

00:35:23.371 --> 00:35:25.707
After that, I won't bring it up again.

00:35:49.272 --> 00:35:50.398
Thank you.

00:35:58.281 --> 00:35:59.824
OFFICIAL BUSINESS

00:36:06.498 --> 00:36:09.000
How do you live here
and not pay your debts?

00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:16.424
Hello.

00:36:16.508 --> 00:36:17.842
Hello!

00:36:19.177 --> 00:36:20.512
What about Mr. Eom?

00:36:20.595 --> 00:36:23.515
He said he had an errand
to do early this morning.

00:36:23.598 --> 00:36:25.350
I guess he'll be a little late.

00:36:27.018 --> 00:36:29.312
Okay, we'll just open the door then.

00:36:29.396 --> 00:36:32.315
We'll open the door
and begin the asset seizure.

00:36:32.399 --> 00:36:34.150
Are you the creditor?

00:36:34.234 --> 00:36:35.944
- Yes.
- Okay, right here.

00:36:36.027 --> 00:36:37.987
Just sign here, please.

00:36:38.071 --> 00:36:39.531
CREDITOR: SON
DEBTOR: KIM

00:36:39.614 --> 00:36:40.740
And…

00:36:41.950 --> 00:36:44.911
- Here.
- Are you the witness for the creditor?

00:36:44.994 --> 00:36:46.079
- Yes.
- Here.

00:36:46.162 --> 00:36:47.664
Please sign here.

00:36:49.624 --> 00:36:50.917
Hey, Jeongsik!

00:36:51.584 --> 00:36:53.294
- What?
- Put that out and come here.

00:36:55.463 --> 00:36:56.881
Here, sign this.

00:36:56.965 --> 00:36:58.341
- Sign it here?
- Yeah.

00:37:00.051 --> 00:37:01.094
Okay.

00:37:02.554 --> 00:37:04.931
All right, then. We'll open the door.

00:37:05.014 --> 00:37:06.099
Okay.

00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:22.741
Excuse me.

00:37:22.824 --> 00:37:24.075
What are you people doing?

00:37:24.159 --> 00:37:26.786
We're from
Seoul Eastern District Court.

00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:31.583
According to case 2024-65123,
we'll proceed with the asset seizure.

00:37:32.459 --> 00:37:35.295
- Sir, please open the door.
- You can't just barge in!

00:37:35.378 --> 00:37:37.255
- Please move, sir.
- Stop it!

00:37:37.338 --> 00:37:39.090
- Come on, sir!
- Sir!

00:37:39.174 --> 00:37:41.009
- How dare you barge in?
- Can I leave now?

00:37:41.092 --> 00:37:44.804
Hang on. You signed as a witness,
so you should at least step inside.

00:37:44.888 --> 00:37:47.098
I'm busy though.

00:37:47.182 --> 00:37:48.433
For goodness' sake.

00:37:48.516 --> 00:37:49.684
Hold on!

00:37:49.768 --> 00:37:50.810
I'm done.

00:37:51.686 --> 00:37:54.355
- Don't waste your energy, dear.
- Right!

00:37:54.439 --> 00:37:56.608
Come in or don't! I don't care!

00:37:58.943 --> 00:38:01.613
- Easy! This flooring isn't cheap.
- Please excuse us.

00:38:01.696 --> 00:38:03.823
What are these fools
doing here this early?

00:38:03.907 --> 00:38:05.200
- Come this way.
- Okay.

00:38:05.283 --> 00:38:07.243
- Hey, upstairs…
- Pay back the money!

00:38:07.327 --> 00:38:09.037
- What money?
- Pay back what you borrowed!

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:12.040
I said I would, you fool!

00:38:12.123 --> 00:38:13.458
Oh, my God!

00:38:13.541 --> 00:38:16.127
If that breaks, you're paying for it!

00:38:16.211 --> 00:38:19.380
- Yes, we'll take care of it.
- Why are you going into the kitchen?

00:38:19.464 --> 00:38:20.924
You scoundrels!

00:38:21.007 --> 00:38:23.718
- Tag that silver tray too.
- What silver tray?

00:38:23.802 --> 00:38:25.428
- That's not silver!
- Sir.

00:38:28.681 --> 00:38:30.558
This is obstruction. Please step aside.

00:38:32.685 --> 00:38:34.562
- Come on!
- That blue painting.

00:38:34.646 --> 00:38:36.064
The blue one? Here it is.

00:38:36.147 --> 00:38:37.148
Hey, who are you?

00:38:37.232 --> 00:38:39.859
For someone looking so clean-cut,
why pull this nonsense?

00:38:39.943 --> 00:38:42.195
- Get out!
- She's the creditor's witness.

00:38:42.278 --> 00:38:44.113
Quiet! Get out of here!

00:38:44.197 --> 00:38:46.074
What a joke!

00:38:48.326 --> 00:38:49.494
Unbelievable!

00:38:49.577 --> 00:38:51.246
You'll be charged with obstruction!

00:38:51.329 --> 00:38:54.040
- Fine, whatever!
- Whatever? Okay!

00:38:54.123 --> 00:38:55.625
Why are you opening that?

00:38:55.708 --> 00:38:59.546
That's where my underwear is!
How dare you touch them, you creep?

00:38:59.629 --> 00:39:01.339
- Are you a pervert?
- Don't be ridiculous!

00:39:01.422 --> 00:39:05.260
- What do you want with women's underwear?
- Geez, I don't want them!

00:39:05.343 --> 00:39:08.471
- Don't stick that label there!
- Yes, ma'am.

00:39:08.555 --> 00:39:12.100
- My clothes are going to get ruined!
- They won't.

00:39:12.183 --> 00:39:15.687
My goodness, this is unbelievable.
Why are you digging through everything?

00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:18.481
- Don't tag that!
- We have to look through all of this.

00:39:18.565 --> 00:39:20.316
I don't believe this!

00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:23.152
- And over here…
- No, not there!

00:39:23.236 --> 00:39:26.114
Gosh, there's a bunch.

00:39:26.197 --> 00:39:28.116
Seriously, that's…

00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:34.914
- What am I going to do?
- Sir!

00:39:34.998 --> 00:39:36.165
- Yes?
- Over here!

00:39:36.249 --> 00:39:38.918
- Just a moment.
- Are you nuts? Why are you opening that?

00:39:40.545 --> 00:39:41.546
My goodness.

00:39:41.629 --> 00:39:43.590
Why did you open that? What are you doing?

00:39:43.673 --> 00:39:45.967
You can't go up! Don't!

00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:47.260
My goodness!

00:39:53.016 --> 00:39:55.643
- I knew it.
- Seriously, these…

00:39:55.727 --> 00:39:57.645
All of these were borrowed, okay?

00:39:57.729 --> 00:40:00.315
We borrowed all of these!

00:40:00.398 --> 00:40:03.443
They're not mine. None of them are mine!

00:40:03.526 --> 00:40:06.988
- Seriously!
- Why on earth are you doing this?

00:40:07.071 --> 00:40:09.699
- What?
- What you're doing is obstruction!

00:40:09.782 --> 00:40:11.868
I want to be naked in my own house!

00:40:11.951 --> 00:40:14.203
So what's it to you?

00:40:14.287 --> 00:40:15.955
- Put it back on!
- Put what on?

00:40:16.039 --> 00:40:18.958
- Get dressed.
- Don't touch me!

00:40:19.042 --> 00:40:21.336
But you touched other people's money!

00:40:21.419 --> 00:40:24.088
I didn't touch a thing! Get out!

00:40:27.592 --> 00:40:30.011
Yeah. That's a good idea.

00:40:30.094 --> 00:40:33.264
Yeah! Let's all strip. Come on!

00:40:33.348 --> 00:40:35.725
Hold on!

00:40:35.808 --> 00:40:37.894
- Happy now? Satisfied?
- How dare you?

00:40:37.977 --> 00:40:39.103
- Do you?
- Get out!

00:40:39.187 --> 00:40:40.480
- Aren't you hot?
- Come out!

00:40:40.563 --> 00:40:42.732
- Take it off! We have nothing to lose!
- Hold on!

00:40:42.815 --> 00:40:44.317
Sir, is this right?

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:46.778
What else can we do
if they keep acting like that?

00:40:48.529 --> 00:40:51.199
Hey! What are you doing there?

00:40:51.282 --> 00:40:52.742
Who said you can use the bathroom?

00:40:52.825 --> 00:40:53.910
You…

00:40:55.662 --> 00:40:56.871
What are you looking at?

00:40:58.623 --> 00:41:01.167
You stripped to make us look
and feel uncomfortable!

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:03.503
Well, we saw
and we were uncomfortable. Happy?

00:41:09.467 --> 00:41:10.468
Gosh.

00:41:14.222 --> 00:41:15.473
I'm sorry, Ms. Kang.

00:41:15.848 --> 00:41:18.768
There must've been an accident somewhere.
Traffic was so bad.

00:41:19.936 --> 00:41:20.937
It's okay.

00:41:22.188 --> 00:41:23.898
Things happen.

00:41:26.359 --> 00:41:27.402
I'm sorry.

00:41:28.736 --> 00:41:30.989
It must have been really tough.

00:41:33.658 --> 00:41:34.701
I'm okay.

00:41:37.161 --> 00:41:38.830
Let's just go.

00:41:44.961 --> 00:41:46.838
I went up to the secret room,

00:41:46.921 --> 00:41:49.465
and there were tons of bags and paintings.

00:41:49.549 --> 00:41:50.925
Then, I heard yelling downstairs.

00:41:51.009 --> 00:41:54.721
I went down and Chairman Kim
was taking off all his clothes.

00:41:54.804 --> 00:41:56.305
- Seriously…
- Gosh.

00:41:56.389 --> 00:41:58.516
See? I told you not to go.

00:41:58.599 --> 00:42:01.436
I told you rich people
aren't easy to deal with.

00:42:01.519 --> 00:42:04.022
They have so much
and don't want to lose any of it.

00:42:04.105 --> 00:42:06.941
Also, it's not something
to be so upset about.

00:42:07.025 --> 00:42:09.652
Rich or not,
people just do whatever they can.

00:42:09.736 --> 00:42:11.154
Come on.

00:42:11.237 --> 00:42:13.406
- That doesn't mean they should.
- Exactly.

00:42:15.491 --> 00:42:16.576
Where's the food?

00:42:17.368 --> 00:42:19.579
I said we shouldn't come here.
The food takes forever.

00:42:19.662 --> 00:42:24.042
That's because
they only start breading the pork cutlets

00:42:24.125 --> 00:42:25.585
right when you order.

00:42:25.668 --> 00:42:27.336
That's why it's so good.

00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:29.630
I have a trial this afternoon.

00:42:29.714 --> 00:42:31.215
Always acting busy.

00:42:31.299 --> 00:42:33.384
You should've brought
your files like I did,

00:42:33.468 --> 00:42:36.012
so you can head straight to court.

00:42:36.095 --> 00:42:38.723
- What trial is it?
- You know. The real estate transfer claim.

00:42:39.432 --> 00:42:41.142
The one against Jang Hyeonseok?

00:42:43.311 --> 00:42:44.437
How did you know?

00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:47.106
That's the case where a savings bank

00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:49.317
was suing a public housing tenant
for eviction.

00:42:50.026 --> 00:42:51.903
It must feel bad to work on the case.

00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:58.242
Did you feel bad
during the asset seizure?

00:42:58.826 --> 00:43:02.205
They both didn't pay, so we acted.
What's there to feel bad about?

00:43:02.288 --> 00:43:05.166
But how did you even know
about Juhyeong's case?

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.252
Jang Hyeonseok came to us for a consult.

00:43:08.878 --> 00:43:11.589
It turned out to be Juhyeong's case.

00:43:11.672 --> 00:43:12.715
By chance?

00:43:12.799 --> 00:43:14.467
Not exactly.

00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:18.387
He wanted me to ask Juhyeong
to drop the case.

00:43:18.971 --> 00:43:20.306
Why didn't you tell me?

00:43:20.389 --> 00:43:23.726
Still, I couldn't ask you to drop it.
It's your job.

00:43:26.604 --> 00:43:27.647
That's surprising.

00:43:28.523 --> 00:43:30.483
I thought you were nosy
like a certain someone.

00:43:30.566 --> 00:43:31.901
I guess you're not that bad.

00:43:39.075 --> 00:43:40.785
Me? Are you talking about me?

00:43:40.868 --> 00:43:42.495
I'm not that bad.

00:43:42.578 --> 00:43:43.913
Why are you so serious?

00:43:43.996 --> 00:43:45.915
I have feelings too, okay?

00:43:45.998 --> 00:43:47.458
- What?
- Here are your pork cutlets.

00:43:47.542 --> 00:43:49.460
Thank you. I'll take mine first.

00:43:49.544 --> 00:43:50.920
Thank you.

00:43:53.464 --> 00:43:55.216
- Shouldn't you eat first?
- Go on and eat.

00:44:00.972 --> 00:44:01.973
See you.

00:44:02.473 --> 00:44:03.891
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:09.021
Coffee?

00:44:14.652 --> 00:44:16.988
Why are you always cold to only me?

00:44:18.156 --> 00:44:20.408
I was cold to only you?

00:44:21.659 --> 00:44:23.244
Do you have main character syndrome?

00:44:24.579 --> 00:44:27.582
If we consider the past,
I should be the one being cold.

00:44:27.665 --> 00:44:29.125
But why are you doing that to me?

00:44:29.876 --> 00:44:31.335
What did I do back then?

00:44:32.378 --> 00:44:34.463
You said we should meet up, and then…

00:44:38.926 --> 00:44:40.428
Never mind. Why bother?

00:44:40.511 --> 00:44:43.556
Well, I wouldn't know
since I don't remember you that well.

00:44:51.314 --> 00:44:53.232
So he's not insane? He's just a jerk?

00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:58.696
Defendant? Mr. Jang Hyeonseok?

00:44:58.779 --> 00:44:59.780
Please sit.

00:45:01.115 --> 00:45:04.493
You sue someone to evict them
just because they missed a payment?

00:45:04.577 --> 00:45:06.454
You call yourself a lawyer?

00:45:07.705 --> 00:45:09.207
Then, you can just repay them.

00:45:09.290 --> 00:45:12.668
Shouldn't the court
be protecting people like me?

00:45:12.752 --> 00:45:13.753
Please sit.

00:45:14.837 --> 00:45:18.174
Counsel for the plaintiff,
is there any chance of a settlement?

00:45:18.925 --> 00:45:22.261
No, the plaintiff won't settle
unless the full amount is repaid.

00:45:22.345 --> 00:45:24.347
If I had the money, I would've paid!

00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:25.765
What do you want me to do?

00:45:25.848 --> 00:45:27.266
Sit down!

00:45:27.350 --> 00:45:28.351
Defendant.

00:45:28.851 --> 00:45:32.521
One more disrespectful outburst,
and I'll hold you in contempt.

00:45:32.605 --> 00:45:34.482
Yes, I'm sorry.

00:45:35.733 --> 00:45:39.862
So Defendant, you can't repay
what you borrowed. Is that correct?

00:45:40.655 --> 00:45:41.656
Yes, that's right.

00:45:41.739 --> 00:45:43.199
Then, it's true.

00:45:43.783 --> 00:45:45.952
So why are you getting this worked up?

00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:54.460
Excuse me, sir!

00:45:55.211 --> 00:45:57.546
Look, isn't there any other way?

00:45:57.630 --> 00:45:59.173
Just pay back the debt.

00:45:59.757 --> 00:46:03.052
But it's not like I'm refusing
to pay on purpose!

00:46:03.135 --> 00:46:04.929
If you borrowed money, please repay it.

00:46:05.513 --> 00:46:07.139
That's our client's stance.

00:46:13.187 --> 00:46:14.772
WE REQUEST THE CLAIMS BE UPHELD

00:46:22.071 --> 00:46:24.407
What a long day!

00:46:26.909 --> 00:46:27.910
Time to go home.

00:46:29.996 --> 00:46:31.038
Time to go home…

00:46:38.004 --> 00:46:40.214
The kid acted out,
so I gave them a warning.

00:46:40.298 --> 00:46:42.341
That's a relief.

00:46:42.425 --> 00:46:45.052
Actually, we're planning
to merge floors 5 through 8.

00:46:45.136 --> 00:46:47.430
So we've started clearing people out.

00:46:49.807 --> 00:46:50.975
Your drink.

00:46:51.809 --> 00:46:53.352
Please, continue.

00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:55.855
I'll get going.

00:47:25.843 --> 00:47:28.012
My goodness, I'm so tired!

00:47:45.529 --> 00:47:47.073
SUPREME COURT UPDATE

00:47:48.532 --> 00:47:50.451
Do they always have to
send these at night?

00:48:16.727 --> 00:48:18.729
A CREDITOR OF A PUBLIC HOUSING TENANT

00:48:18.813 --> 00:48:20.689
TERMINATED THE LEASE ON THEIR BEHALF

00:48:32.326 --> 00:48:34.245
A CREDITOR OF A PUBLIC HOUSING TENANT

00:48:34.328 --> 00:48:36.497
TERMINATED THE LEASE ON THEIR BEHALF

00:48:39.125 --> 00:48:40.835
What are we supposed to do now?

00:48:41.377 --> 00:48:44.004
I'm here for a divorce consultation.

00:48:44.088 --> 00:48:45.089
I see.

00:48:47.466 --> 00:48:49.385
- Sir.
- Thank you.

00:48:55.224 --> 00:48:58.686
The Supreme Court set a new precedent.
The case is exactly like ours.

00:48:58.769 --> 00:49:02.314
It says going forward, it'll be harder
to evict public housing tenants

00:49:02.398 --> 00:49:03.983
like Jang Hyeonseok.

00:49:04.066 --> 00:49:05.317
Then, what?

00:49:05.401 --> 00:49:08.070
Given this, dropping the lawsuit
would be the right move.

00:49:09.238 --> 00:49:11.866
LAW GROUP KYUNGMIN

00:49:11.949 --> 00:49:17.538
Listen, these public housing leases
run 10, sometimes 20 years.

00:49:17.621 --> 00:49:19.707
So we just sit and wait until it ends?

00:49:20.666 --> 00:49:24.420
That would mean a huge loss for our bank.
Isn't there anything we can do?

00:49:24.503 --> 00:49:27.047
This precedent
literally came out yesterday.

00:49:27.131 --> 00:49:28.841
Jang Hyeonseok probably doesn't know,

00:49:28.924 --> 00:49:31.594
and even the judge
may not be aware of it yet.

00:49:32.386 --> 00:49:33.429
Then, what do we do?

00:49:34.722 --> 00:49:36.557
Just because we know about this precedent

00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:39.018
doesn't mean we're obligated
to bring it up.

00:49:40.102 --> 00:49:41.896
- Let's proceed as is.
- Is that okay?

00:49:42.563 --> 00:49:45.024
Yes, that's what we should do.

00:49:46.692 --> 00:49:47.776
Act natural.

00:49:48.819 --> 00:49:52.156
- Don't look here and just act natural.
- Hurry up and take it!

00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:54.325
- There you go.
- Can I eat naturally?

00:49:54.408 --> 00:49:55.659
No, wait!

00:49:55.743 --> 00:49:57.620
- Hurry up.
- Hold on!

00:49:57.703 --> 00:49:59.747
- You're taking all day!
- Help me out!

00:49:59.830 --> 00:50:00.831
The cream is melting.

00:50:02.333 --> 00:50:05.169
- Done? Can I eat the cake?
- Hold on.

00:50:05.252 --> 00:50:09.048
Isn't your blog called "A Lawyer's Table?"
Why take photos of drinks then?

00:50:09.131 --> 00:50:11.759
That narrow-minded mindset
won't get you far.

00:50:13.093 --> 00:50:14.094
Then rename it.

00:50:15.137 --> 00:50:16.555
"A Lawyer's Food and Beverage."

00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:18.682
That sounds awful.

00:50:18.766 --> 00:50:19.975
- Come on.
- What?

00:50:20.726 --> 00:50:21.769
What?

00:50:22.269 --> 00:50:23.437
No one called you.

00:50:25.314 --> 00:50:27.983
- What are you so deep in thought about?
- It's nothing.

00:50:28.067 --> 00:50:29.985
What do you mean "It's nothing"?

00:50:30.069 --> 00:50:33.489
Even through the camera,
I can see your face is full of worry.

00:50:33.572 --> 00:50:36.075
Yeah, spill it. Big bro's listening.

00:50:37.159 --> 00:50:39.662
Did you have a blind date
and you liked her?

00:50:39.745 --> 00:50:41.705
- How about another bet?
- There she goes again.

00:50:41.789 --> 00:50:43.958
I guess you saw the precedent.

00:50:44.041 --> 00:50:45.501
Isn't that what it's about?

00:50:47.503 --> 00:50:48.963
Wait, you read it?

00:50:49.046 --> 00:50:50.714
- It came out yesterday.
- Wait.

00:50:51.423 --> 00:50:53.467
You read a precedent
that came out yesterday?

00:50:55.052 --> 00:50:56.554
Is there an exam we need to take?

00:50:56.637 --> 00:50:57.930
What's with you two?

00:50:58.013 --> 00:51:00.057
You're dropping the case
because of it, right?

00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:01.433
Nope. We're not dropping it.

00:51:02.476 --> 00:51:03.519
You're not?

00:51:04.812 --> 00:51:06.689
In that case,
the plaintiff was also a bank,

00:51:06.772 --> 00:51:08.857
and the defendant
was a public housing tenant.

00:51:09.525 --> 00:51:12.069
They used the deposit
as collateral when the loan was given.

00:51:12.152 --> 00:51:15.447
- It's the exact same as yours.
- Were you shut down by the precedent?

00:51:15.531 --> 00:51:18.784
- Wasn't it going to be an easy win?
- I know. I read it carefully too.

00:51:19.702 --> 00:51:23.497
Wait! How did you even find out
about a precedent that came out yesterday?

00:51:23.581 --> 00:51:25.749
But if you proceed,
you'll lose the case.

00:51:29.962 --> 00:51:32.298
I might've lost against you,

00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:34.425
but not with these two.

00:51:36.802 --> 00:51:38.012
What?

00:51:38.095 --> 00:51:40.973
- Did you know about it?
- I have no idea what you're talking about.

00:51:41.056 --> 00:51:43.183
- Can't we win too?
- Did you see it yesterday?

00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:46.895
- I guess not.
- Can we not while we eat?

00:51:46.979 --> 00:51:49.565
- Not reading is normal.
- You just jumped to that conclusion.

00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:55.988
He's not just a jerk.
He's a total thug.

00:52:02.453 --> 00:52:03.954
ASK AHN JUHYEONG FOR DIFFICULT CASES

00:52:04.038 --> 00:52:06.665
How am I supposed to ask
a jerk like this for advice?

00:52:11.170 --> 00:52:13.922
COMPLAINT

00:52:21.221 --> 00:52:24.308
DEFENDANT'S DEFAULT
AND EVENT OF DEFAULT

00:52:24.391 --> 00:52:27.102
COMPLAINT FILED BY LAW GROUP KYUNGMIN
ATTORNEYS NA, AHN

00:52:40.074 --> 00:52:41.533
Yes, this case was continued,

00:52:41.617 --> 00:52:45.287
because the defendant
requested more time to repay the loan.

00:52:45.371 --> 00:52:48.165
So, has there been
any progress since then?

00:52:49.375 --> 00:52:52.544
Your Honor, I haven't paid it back yet,

00:52:52.628 --> 00:52:56.590
but I brought a written statement
that I'd like to submit.

00:53:02.763 --> 00:53:05.140
RECEIPT

00:53:05.224 --> 00:53:07.226

00:53:17.444 --> 00:53:19.363
WRITTEN STATEMENT

00:53:19.446 --> 00:53:22.199
LATEST SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT

00:53:22.282 --> 00:53:25.994
- You said I could play with it after you!
- It's not even yours!

00:53:26.078 --> 00:53:27.746
I want to play with my friends too!

00:53:27.830 --> 00:53:30.249
Don't run!
The neighbors are going to complain!

00:53:30.332 --> 00:53:33.168
- Honey, stop.
- You promised I could play after you!

00:53:33.252 --> 00:53:36.046
We don't even know
how long we'll be staying here.

00:53:40.342 --> 00:53:41.427
- Who's that?
- Who is it?

00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:42.678
Hush. Wait inside.

00:53:55.149 --> 00:53:56.150
Hello.

00:54:10.414 --> 00:54:12.958
They're notes my predecessor wrote.

00:54:13.041 --> 00:54:15.335
I don't understand the part he marked.

00:54:15.419 --> 00:54:17.337
Gosh, look at these insane indents.

00:54:17.421 --> 00:54:19.506
I know.
That firm always formats like that.

00:54:23.969 --> 00:54:25.888
I'm not an expert,

00:54:25.971 --> 00:54:29.933
but I heard the Supreme Court
recently ruled that people like me

00:54:30.017 --> 00:54:33.145
can't be kicked out anymore,
so I submitted that information.

00:54:33.228 --> 00:54:34.938
There was a relevant precedent?

00:54:35.481 --> 00:54:37.649
Counsel for the plaintiff,
were you aware of this?

00:54:38.609 --> 00:54:39.943
- Yes.
- With this precedent,

00:54:40.027 --> 00:54:42.196
it's hard to say

00:54:42.279 --> 00:54:46.283
that the defendant
still has an obligation to vacate.

00:54:46.366 --> 00:54:48.994
Counsel for the plaintiff,
have you had time to review this?

00:54:50.162 --> 00:54:52.873
We'll take a closer look
and either withdraw the claim

00:54:52.956 --> 00:54:55.334
or submit a rebuttal
before the next hearing.

00:54:55.417 --> 00:54:56.418
All right, please do.

00:54:57.628 --> 00:54:59.004
But it seems to me

00:54:59.588 --> 00:55:03.050
that a withdrawal
might be your best option.

00:55:04.635 --> 00:55:06.136
I'll discuss it with my client.

00:55:12.601 --> 00:55:16.021
Sir, I'm sorry.

00:55:16.104 --> 00:55:20.943
I became so angry during the last trial
and acted so rudely towards you.

00:55:21.026 --> 00:55:22.819
I'm not usually like that.

00:55:22.903 --> 00:55:24.321
No, it's all right.

00:55:24.404 --> 00:55:27.074
I just didn't want to end up
out on the street.

00:55:29.368 --> 00:55:31.245
We're all just doing whatever we can.

00:55:31.828 --> 00:55:33.914
You didn't have
any personal animosity towards me.

00:55:34.706 --> 00:55:36.792
- Don't worry about it.
- Thank you.

00:56:02.484 --> 00:56:04.653
You were taking too long,
so we started eating.

00:56:04.736 --> 00:56:07.322
- We literally just started.
- How was your trial?

00:56:08.490 --> 00:56:09.533
Come eat.

00:56:12.619 --> 00:56:13.954
What was that, Ms. Kang?

00:56:15.497 --> 00:56:16.498
It was pro bono.

00:56:16.999 --> 00:56:20.168
Someone was focused on personal gain,
so I did some public interest work.

00:56:20.252 --> 00:56:22.504
You should've officially signed on
and shown up then.

00:56:23.714 --> 00:56:25.591
Are you mad I didn't show up at court?

00:56:25.674 --> 00:56:27.050
I'm not mad.

00:56:30.345 --> 00:56:32.264
- What happened?
- I think we should stay quiet.

00:56:33.181 --> 00:56:34.975
You said you weren't that nosy.

00:56:35.976 --> 00:56:38.395
But that wasn't pro bono.
That was meddling.

00:56:39.146 --> 00:56:40.939
The precedent's already out.

00:56:41.523 --> 00:56:43.191
It's not like I made it up.

00:56:43.275 --> 00:56:46.695
- I just let things follow their course.
- Do you agree with that precedent?

00:56:48.655 --> 00:56:50.866
- What?
- Do you agree with the Supreme Court?

00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:56.246
Are you saying you disagree with it?

00:57:00.542 --> 00:57:03.962
Public housing exists to protect people
who have a hard time

00:57:04.046 --> 00:57:05.839
finding homes like Jang Hyeonseok.

00:57:05.922 --> 00:57:08.050
You can't just kick them out so easily.

00:57:08.133 --> 00:57:09.801
You think I'm the bad guy.

00:57:09.885 --> 00:57:11.762
You wonder why I took this case.

00:57:12.512 --> 00:57:15.932
I'm not criticizing you for taking it.

00:57:16.016 --> 00:57:18.435
But you should at least
feel uneasy about it.

00:57:19.061 --> 00:57:20.937
You should be aware of what you're doing.

00:57:23.023 --> 00:57:24.733
You said it was "public interest work"?

00:57:26.193 --> 00:57:28.403
Are you sure that really was
in the public's interest?

00:57:30.697 --> 00:57:33.950
For lawyers, public interest means
defending their client's rights.

00:57:34.576 --> 00:57:36.953
Making the other side
accountable for their violations.

00:57:37.037 --> 00:57:38.622
That is public interest.

00:57:38.705 --> 00:57:40.165
Thinking beyond that is arrogance.

00:57:40.248 --> 00:57:42.125
Does that belief make you feel better?

00:57:42.709 --> 00:57:45.337
It's not that thought of arrogance
holding you back.

00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:47.756
You just lack the courage
to think that far.

00:57:47.839 --> 00:57:50.967
It seems you're the one
who doesn't know what they're saying.

00:57:51.051 --> 00:57:54.471
What do you think would happen
if I told the bank to drop the lawsuit

00:57:54.554 --> 00:57:57.474
and that they can't sue anyone
who can't repay anymore?

00:57:57.557 --> 00:57:59.393
What do you think
would immediately happen?

00:57:59.476 --> 00:58:01.937
Less people would be kicked out
of their homes by banks.

00:58:02.020 --> 00:58:05.357
Banks are going to stop lending
to people like Jang Hyeonseok.

00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:08.568
The world isn't that black and white.

00:58:08.652 --> 00:58:11.446
If one thing changes,
everything else related to it changes.

00:58:11.530 --> 00:58:13.407
We're sorry, sir.

00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:17.494
For now, we can't offer deposit loans
for public housing.

00:58:17.577 --> 00:58:19.538
It's due to a Supreme Court precedent.

00:58:19.621 --> 00:58:22.332
That was for people
who didn't repay their loans.

00:58:22.416 --> 00:58:24.584
- I don't miss my interest payments.
- I'm sorry.

00:58:24.668 --> 00:58:26.378
So even if awarded public housing,

00:58:26.461 --> 00:58:29.881
more people won't be able to move in
because they can't cover the deposit.

00:58:29.965 --> 00:58:32.926
If collateral can't be enforced,
you think banks would still lend?

00:58:33.009 --> 00:58:37.222
That means the ones who borrow
and repay properly end up suffering.

00:58:37.848 --> 00:58:39.975
And still, you're certain
this is public interest?

00:58:40.058 --> 00:58:41.435
Why do you only see one side?

00:58:41.518 --> 00:58:45.897
When a person loses their home,
their entire world falls apart.

00:58:47.315 --> 00:58:50.318
Do you think one person's world
counts as public interest?

00:58:54.573 --> 00:58:55.741
Hey, stop it.

00:58:55.824 --> 00:58:57.117
- You're so loud.
- She's right.

00:58:57.200 --> 00:58:58.744
Hey, cut it out!

00:58:58.827 --> 00:59:01.496
You said not to act like a lawyer,
but you're doing it the most!

00:59:01.580 --> 00:59:05.167
Sorry, don't mind us. Please eat. Sorry.

00:59:05.250 --> 00:59:07.794
Eat before your food gets cold.

00:59:10.964 --> 00:59:12.382
- Let's eat.
- Sorry.

00:59:12.466 --> 00:59:15.594
We're really sorry.

00:59:19.514 --> 00:59:21.516
- Have you made a decision?
- Yes.

00:59:23.518 --> 00:59:25.312
Please file the withdrawal.

00:59:26.188 --> 00:59:28.482
We've reviewed it internally

00:59:29.691 --> 00:59:32.527
and decided to look for another solution.

00:59:33.069 --> 00:59:34.070
I see.

00:59:35.071 --> 00:59:37.949
I'll also think it over
and see if there's another way.

00:59:38.533 --> 00:59:39.534
Okay.

00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:43.663
Withdrawing is simple.

00:59:44.289 --> 00:59:45.707
But the issue is what will follow.

00:59:50.879 --> 00:59:51.880
I know.

01:00:17.614 --> 01:00:19.699
- It's dragging on for a while.
- What is?

01:00:21.952 --> 01:00:23.203
Come on!

01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:26.331
You've known each other 10 years.
Let's make up.

01:00:26.414 --> 01:00:27.916
Shake hands. Okay?

01:00:27.999 --> 01:00:29.668
Ten years? Says who?

01:00:29.751 --> 01:00:31.336
Ten years, my foot.

01:00:32.629 --> 01:00:34.422
You were the one who first said that.

01:00:34.506 --> 01:00:37.300
Changwon, I think we should stay quiet.

01:00:38.134 --> 01:00:40.679
- Why am I always told to stay quiet?
- Have some dumplings.

01:00:41.972 --> 01:00:42.973
Thanks.

01:00:44.432 --> 01:00:45.809
You knew I liked dumplings?

01:01:08.248 --> 01:01:11.293
I'm not criticizing you for taking it.

01:01:12.043 --> 01:01:14.462
But you should at least
feel uneasy about it.

01:01:14.546 --> 01:01:16.464
You should be aware of what you're doing.

01:01:17.007 --> 01:01:21.011
When a person loses their home,
their entire world falls apart.

01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:25.056
What does she know?

01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:27.017
As if I haven't had those thoughts either.

01:01:43.116 --> 01:01:45.952
If one thing changes,
everything else related to it changes.

01:01:54.544 --> 01:01:57.589
For lawyers, public interest means
defending their client's rights.

01:01:57.672 --> 01:02:00.425
Making the other side
accountable for their violations.

01:02:00.508 --> 01:02:02.052
That is public interest.

01:02:02.135 --> 01:02:03.887
Thinking beyond that is arrogance.

01:02:03.970 --> 01:02:05.889
He's the most arrogant one.

01:02:18.652 --> 01:02:21.154

01:03:24.592 --> 01:03:25.802
NEW MAIL ALERT

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:29.931
MERGER ANNOUNCEMENT

01:03:32.851 --> 01:03:34.602
AS OF TODAY, LAW GROUP KYUNGMIN

01:03:34.686 --> 01:03:37.856
HAS OFFICIALLY ENTERED
THE PROCESS OF A MERGER

01:03:37.939 --> 01:03:39.774
WITH JOHWA, CHUNGGONG, AND HOJEON

01:03:45.613 --> 01:03:46.865
A merger?

01:03:53.455 --> 01:03:55.665
LAW GROUP HYUNGMIN

01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:07.177
Where did he run off to?

01:05:35.014 --> 01:05:37.350
I BELIEVE I'M REMEMBERING IT CORRECTLY

01:05:37.433 --> 01:05:39.561
THIS IS KIND OF RIDICULOUS

01:05:39.644 --> 01:05:41.771
{\an8}KANG HUIJI

01:05:56.077 --> 01:06:03.042
{\an8}Law and The City

01:06:32.113 --> 01:06:35.825
Law and The City

01:06:36.743 --> 01:06:38.161
{\an8}Just be honest.

01:06:38.828 --> 01:06:40.079
{\an8}You remember, don't you?

01:06:42.332 --> 01:06:44.042
{\an8}You're still pretty though.

01:06:46.085 --> 01:06:48.254
{\an8}I guess the merger really did happen.

01:06:48.338 --> 01:06:50.173
{\an8}We're all under one roof now.

01:06:50.256 --> 01:06:51.466
{\an8}Don't get empathize.

01:06:51.549 --> 01:06:53.635
{\an8}You'll lose objectivity
and hinder your work.

01:06:53.718 --> 01:06:55.929
{\an8}You don't empathize,
because you can't feel anything.

01:06:56.012 --> 01:06:57.472
{\an8}It's not by choice, okay?

01:06:59.807 --> 01:07:03.269
{\an8}- Are you really a lawyer?
- It's all on her.

01:07:03.353 --> 01:07:05.188
{\an8}Something feels off.

01:07:05.271 --> 01:07:06.981
{\an8}Either way, someone died, Mr. Kim!

01:07:07.523 --> 01:07:08.816
{\an8}Need help with something?

01:07:14.322 --> 01:07:16.324
