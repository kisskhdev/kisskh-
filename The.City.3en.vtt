ALL CHILD ACTORS FILMED SAFELY
WITH PARENTAL SUPERVISION

00:01:47.232 --> 00:01:49.192
What are you looking at
with such interest?

00:01:49.985 --> 00:01:51.695
What brings you here?

00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:53.280
I was about to ask you the same.

00:01:53.363 --> 00:01:54.573
What brings you here?

00:01:54.656 --> 00:01:56.408
It was written in the handover notes.

00:01:56.491 --> 00:01:58.577
It said to come here
when I needed to relax.

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.705
He sure made the handover notes detailed.

00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:03.165
I come here often to run.

00:02:05.292 --> 00:02:07.336
Did you just go for a run?

00:02:12.382 --> 00:02:13.383
Didn't you see me?

00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:15.260
- I didn't.
- I'm pretty sure you did.

00:02:16.678 --> 00:02:19.264
- Why would I lie about that?
- You're good at lying.

00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:23.101
You really are a strange person.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.395
When have I ever lied?

00:02:30.025 --> 00:02:31.151
Back then, in Hong Kong.

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:34.529
We never said we'd meet again
once we returned to Seoul.

00:02:36.531 --> 00:02:37.949
Just be honest.

00:02:38.492 --> 00:02:40.035
You remember, don't you?

00:02:41.453 --> 00:02:43.872
It came back to me afterward.
It came back to me but--

00:02:43.955 --> 00:02:45.582
You remembered from the very start.

00:02:45.666 --> 00:02:49.670
Also, you clearly asked me
to meet you in Seoul.

00:02:49.753 --> 00:02:51.046
If there's a spot…

00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:54.466
like this in Seoul,
want to go together?

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:56.718
Where?

00:02:59.638 --> 00:03:00.639
Gangnam Station.

00:03:04.351 --> 00:03:05.435
Gangnam Station.

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.354
We even picked a date and place.

00:03:07.437 --> 00:03:08.563
Right, we did.

00:03:08.647 --> 00:03:09.648
So?

00:03:10.232 --> 00:03:12.317
But you're the one who canceled it.

00:03:13.777 --> 00:03:14.778
I did?

00:03:15.278 --> 00:03:16.571
By the way,

00:03:16.655 --> 00:03:18.990
do you think we'll be together
back in Seoul?

00:03:20.784 --> 00:03:21.785
Well…

00:03:22.452 --> 00:03:24.746
We agreed to meet up in Seoul.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.624
But we didn't actually
make any solid plans yet.

00:03:31.253 --> 00:03:35.715
Since we're on a trip, I thought maybe
we're just caught up in the mood and all.

00:03:41.012 --> 00:03:45.183
How is that canceling our plans?
That's not what I meant.

00:03:45.267 --> 00:03:47.811
That is what you meant.
What else could it be?

00:03:50.397 --> 00:03:54.067
Don't you know what "be together" means?

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:01.783
Come on. That's not the vibe
you gave off back then.

00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:05.412
If it was, then why did you
ghost me in Seoul?

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:08.290
That's just more proof
that you wanted to cancel.

00:04:08.373 --> 00:04:11.668
I didn't ignore you on purpose.
Back then, my phone--

00:04:14.337 --> 00:04:16.715
Don't tell me you lost your phone.

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.634
You're right. I lost it.

00:04:27.601 --> 00:04:31.188
I arrived at the airport for my flight,
but I couldn't find it anywhere.

00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:32.564
Geez!

00:04:34.024 --> 00:04:38.528
Since your number was saved on that phone,
I couldn't switch to a new one.

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:41.865
I even emailed the places in Hong Kong
but never found it.

00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:43.492
I'm supposed to believe that?

00:04:43.575 --> 00:04:45.994
Geez, you're such a strange person.

00:04:46.077 --> 00:04:47.329
Why won't you believe me?

00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:48.872
Because you're a good liar.

00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:50.749
When did I ever lie to you?

00:04:51.625 --> 00:04:54.836
In any case, you were the one
who said we should meet up.

00:04:55.545 --> 00:04:57.506
Why say it
if you weren't going to show up?

00:04:57.589 --> 00:04:59.716
Because I liked you.

00:05:07.933 --> 00:05:10.769
Back then. Not now.

00:05:12.896 --> 00:05:13.980
Yes, I know.

00:05:15.982 --> 00:05:18.568
You were pretty and kind back then.

00:05:18.652 --> 00:05:20.779
Now, it seems you've become kind of weird.

00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:24.157
Who? Me and not yourself?

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:25.951
You're still pretty though.

00:05:37.295 --> 00:05:38.421
You're not heading back?

00:05:40.549 --> 00:05:41.925
I was about to.

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:43.510
Let's go.

00:05:49.057 --> 00:05:52.018
Episode 3
How to Separate Work from Personal Life

00:05:57.023 --> 00:05:59.693
{\an8}I'm sorry about Jang Hyeonseok's case.

00:06:00.861 --> 00:06:04.573
{\an8}It was your case,
but I acted like I knew better.

00:06:05.824 --> 00:06:08.743
{\an8}I still don't think I was wrong,

00:06:08.827 --> 00:06:11.746
{\an8}and I believe the judge
should've been shown that precedent.

00:06:12.622 --> 00:06:15.417
But I can't deny that I was being nosy.

00:06:16.877 --> 00:06:20.088
I never even thought about it
from the standpoints you mentioned.

00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:24.676
Are you apologizing right now?

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:26.636
I have to admit what's true.

00:06:27.262 --> 00:06:30.724
But like you said, I'm just a first-year.

00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:34.477
What's the worth of going all out
to fight a first-year over that?

00:06:35.186 --> 00:06:37.772
If I didn't know,
you could've just explained it nicely.

00:06:43.111 --> 00:06:45.572
By the way, didn't you say
you were a piano major then?

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:48.283
I never imagined you'd become a lawyer.

00:06:51.536 --> 00:06:53.788
I totally knew you'd become a lawyer.

00:06:53.872 --> 00:06:56.666
Well, obviously.
I was a law student back then.

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:59.836
That doesn't guarantee you'll make it.
You could've failed the exam.

00:07:00.712 --> 00:07:01.880
Me?

00:07:01.963 --> 00:07:06.801
Then, why would your handover notes say
to ask me if you didn't know something?

00:07:06.885 --> 00:07:08.470
It's because I'm good.

00:07:08.553 --> 00:07:10.430
What's the use?

00:07:10.513 --> 00:07:12.641
You're so scary I can't even ask.

00:07:14.559 --> 00:07:17.437
Fine. I'll help you as much as I can.

00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:19.439
Nicely?

00:07:19.522 --> 00:07:20.774
Well, I can't promise that.

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:27.489
- Then, can I ask you something now?
- Right now?

00:07:28.657 --> 00:07:30.867
When were you planning to start? Tomorrow?

00:07:32.744 --> 00:07:33.953
Go ahead.

00:07:35.914 --> 00:07:39.709
What do you do when you're assigned a case
you don't want to take?

00:07:40.293 --> 00:07:42.587
What employee actually gets to do
what they want?

00:07:42.671 --> 00:07:46.508
You just do the job
without thinking about it.

00:07:46.591 --> 00:07:49.010
Still, we're not just regular employees.

00:07:49.094 --> 00:07:50.512
We get a paycheck, don't we?

00:07:51.054 --> 00:07:52.055
We're the same.

00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:53.390
We're lawyers though.

00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:54.641
Just salaried lawyers.

00:07:55.725 --> 00:07:58.353
I can't agree with this mindset either.

00:07:59.354 --> 00:08:00.355
But fine.

00:08:01.022 --> 00:08:03.900
It means even you have cases
you don't want to handle, right?

00:08:05.193 --> 00:08:06.653
Yes. Family cases.

00:08:07.195 --> 00:08:10.407
There's too much emotion involved
with the parties, so it's exhausting.

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:12.951
Aren't family cases
the most interesting ones?

00:08:13.868 --> 00:08:16.705
Things like affairs, divorces,
and inheritances.

00:08:16.788 --> 00:08:20.500
You think cheating, broken families,
and people dying are interesting?

00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:27.340
When you put it like that,
it doesn't sound so good.

00:08:30.719 --> 00:08:33.096
You tried to make me feel bad
on purpose, didn't you?

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:34.681
I told you to let me know nicely.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:37.684
I said I couldn't promise that.

00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:43.398
PRECEDENT ON PUNISHMENTS
FOR ACTS OF VIOLENCE

00:09:14.929 --> 00:09:16.014
He's a weird one.

00:09:36.785 --> 00:09:39.037
Hyungmin Building's…

00:09:42.916 --> 00:09:44.459
Law Group Hyungmin.

00:09:46.503 --> 00:09:47.504
{\an8}Right?

00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:56.096
A LAW GROUP COMMITTED TO YOU

00:09:56.179 --> 00:09:57.180
OUR TEAM

00:09:57.263 --> 00:09:59.057
I guess the merger really did happen.

00:10:00.308 --> 00:10:02.977
Right? What kind of company
merges in just two weeks?

00:10:03.061 --> 00:10:05.438
There are 15 lawyers in total,

00:10:05.939 --> 00:10:07.524
but four are managing partners?

00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:10.610
Out of 15 lawyers,
around 10 are members of the team.

00:10:10.693 --> 00:10:12.362
And only five are associates.

00:10:13.154 --> 00:10:15.281
You mean the other members
are partners, right?

00:10:15.365 --> 00:10:17.700
{\an8}Yeah, and they all operate separately.

00:10:18.618 --> 00:10:21.121
{\an8}Still, we're all under one roof now.

00:10:21.204 --> 00:10:22.580
We're not in the same company.

00:10:22.664 --> 00:10:24.499
Technically, we are in the same company.

00:10:24.582 --> 00:10:25.792
Don't kill the mood.

00:10:26.668 --> 00:10:28.628
Thanks. You're the best.

00:10:29.379 --> 00:10:32.048
{\an8}What's with Changwon's photo?
Where did he take this?

00:10:32.132 --> 00:10:33.967
{\an8}Seriously,
are you some kind of musician?

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:35.552
{\an8}What? It came out great.

00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:37.679
{\an8}- No, it's…
- The break room's nice, isn't it?

00:10:38.721 --> 00:10:41.307
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:10:44.227 --> 00:10:45.770
Attorney Ahn Juhyeong,

00:10:46.396 --> 00:10:47.856

Attorney Bae Munjeong,

00:10:51.818 --> 00:10:54.237
Attorney Ha Sanggi, and…

00:10:56.614 --> 00:10:58.408
Attorney Cho Changwon, right?

00:10:58.491 --> 00:10:59.534
Nice to meet you.

00:11:00.368 --> 00:11:02.787
Make yourselves at home.

00:11:02.871 --> 00:11:05.165
Let me know if you need anything.

00:11:05.248 --> 00:11:06.374
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:16.217
Well, my office is over there.

00:11:17.177 --> 00:11:18.344
- Yes.
- Right.

00:11:19.596 --> 00:11:20.597
Have a good day.

00:11:27.562 --> 00:11:28.563
Gosh.

00:11:30.815 --> 00:11:32.984
What exactly do you do
as an advisor though?

00:11:34.944 --> 00:11:36.654
Maybe she adds people to a vise.

Now, let's raise our glasses high

00:12:27.914 --> 00:12:30.124
I do have one condition.

00:12:30.208 --> 00:12:33.253
I'd like to be made a legal advisor.

00:12:33.336 --> 00:12:34.879
In return,

00:12:34.963 --> 00:12:38.007
I'll provide the entire 4th floor
as a break room.

00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:39.092
Gosh!

00:12:41.928 --> 00:12:42.971
Goodness!

00:12:43.888 --> 00:12:46.474
Gosh.
Pretending to be tough was so exhausting.

I'm so proud of you, my son.

00:15:03.611 --> 00:15:05.154
Because you're such a strong boy.

00:15:10.159 --> 00:15:11.619

00:15:13.996 --> 00:15:15.081
Doctor!

00:15:15.164 --> 00:15:16.249
- Geunhwan.
- Doctor!

00:15:18.334 --> 00:15:19.377
Geunhwan?

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:21.671
Honey, get out of the way.

00:15:21.754 --> 00:15:23.840
- Move.
- Geunhwan?

00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:25.174
Call a Code Blue.

00:15:28.719 --> 00:15:29.804
Geunhwan?

00:15:30.429 --> 00:15:31.556
Geunhwan!

00:15:54.537 --> 00:15:56.914
There's no way our professor
made a surgical error.

00:15:56.998 --> 00:15:59.083
By the way,
how do you two know each other?

00:15:59.167 --> 00:16:02.128
I'm Kim Jeongsu,
head of Administration at the hospital.

00:16:02.211 --> 00:16:03.880
I told them I could come alone,

00:16:03.963 --> 00:16:06.382
but I think the hospital
wanted someone with me.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:11.387
You're not the only defendant.
The hospital is too. That's why I'm here.

00:16:12.972 --> 00:16:14.974
This is the surgery footage.

00:16:15.057 --> 00:16:18.603
As you'll see, he didn't make any mistakes
during the operation.

00:16:20.313 --> 00:16:22.648
Were you aware that the surgery
was being recorded?

00:16:23.691 --> 00:16:26.736
Yes, we film every procedure
from start to finish.

00:16:28.362 --> 00:16:30.823
- Did he die on the same day?
- Yes, in the evening.

00:16:30.907 --> 00:16:32.658
- Any criminal charges?
- Yes.

00:16:33.659 --> 00:16:36.370
But medical negligence wasn't found,
so they were dismissed.

00:16:36.871 --> 00:16:40.082
I believe the family is trying
a civil suit as a last resort.

00:16:40.625 --> 00:16:44.086
Looking at the complaint,
they didn't make any new claims.

00:16:45.546 --> 00:16:48.549
Are you here to keep Prof. Ku quiet?

00:16:50.301 --> 00:16:51.552
What?

00:16:54.096 --> 00:16:55.097
No, not at all.

00:16:56.265 --> 00:16:58.226
You've been answering everything for him.

00:16:58.309 --> 00:17:01.520
So I was just wondering
why he wasn't allowed to speak.

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:03.856
No, there's nothing like that.

00:17:05.233 --> 00:17:07.443
What kind of surgery
did the patient receive?

00:17:13.574 --> 00:17:14.784
He had diverticulitis.

00:17:14.867 --> 00:17:18.287
But there was a perforation,
so we couldn't do a laparoscopy

00:17:18.371 --> 00:17:19.997
and did an open surgery instead.

00:17:20.081 --> 00:17:22.833
After the surgery,
he suddenly went into shock and died.

00:17:22.917 --> 00:17:24.335
"Diverticulitis."

00:17:25.044 --> 00:17:27.797
Sorry, I'm not familiar,
but what exactly is that?

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:32.134
It's when little, bulging pouches develop
in the wall of the colon.

00:17:32.218 --> 00:17:35.680
If waste gets trapped in those pouches,
it can lead to inflammation,

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:37.431
and they can often rupture.

00:17:37.515 --> 00:17:40.142
- So in this case, there was a perforation?
- Yes.

00:17:41.269 --> 00:17:44.230
It's a claim for damages,

00:17:44.313 --> 00:17:48.317
saying the surgery was negligent,
the risks weren't properly explained,

00:17:48.818 --> 00:17:50.987
and the surgeon arrived late.

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:53.155
Can't I just apologize

00:17:53.239 --> 00:17:55.408
- and end this with a settlement?
- Professor.

00:17:56.576 --> 00:17:58.244
You said you would stop saying that.

00:17:58.327 --> 00:18:00.329
Either way, someone died, Mr. Kim!

00:18:05.167 --> 00:18:09.130
So, you've been a surgeon
for quite a while, right?

00:18:09.213 --> 00:18:10.298
Yes, well…

00:18:11.674 --> 00:18:13.217
It's been about 20 years.

00:18:13.301 --> 00:18:16.262
Then, this probably wasn't
the first time you've lost a patient.

00:18:16.345 --> 00:18:18.639
No, it wasn't.

00:18:20.433 --> 00:18:21.767
Do you usually

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:25.229
apologize and settle with the family
whenever this happens?

00:18:26.522 --> 00:18:27.523
No.

00:18:28.357 --> 00:18:29.358
Not always.

00:18:29.442 --> 00:18:32.820
Then, may I ask why
you want to apologize this time?

00:18:34.405 --> 00:18:36.490
I've never lost a patient
this young before.

00:18:37.408 --> 00:18:40.411
As a doctor, I hate saying
some lives matter more than others,

00:18:41.203 --> 00:18:42.455
but this one's been hard.

00:18:43.831 --> 00:18:47.668
But an apology could be used
as evidence of negligence.

00:18:47.752 --> 00:18:49.545
Please think about the hospital too.

00:18:49.629 --> 00:18:51.714
That may not necessarily be the case.

00:18:52.298 --> 00:18:55.301
If there's no other evidence
of surgical malpractice,

00:18:55.384 --> 00:18:57.887
an apology alone isn't enough
to prove liability.

00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:00.514
Still, it could make the hospital
look at fault,

00:19:00.598 --> 00:19:02.767
and that could blow things up even more.

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:05.811
On top of that,
you want to offer a settlement too?

00:19:05.895 --> 00:19:07.063
When we were sued,

00:19:08.022 --> 00:19:10.274
wasn't it enough
to stop me from apologizing?

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:12.234
Now that we've been cleared,

00:19:12.943 --> 00:19:14.654
let's apologize and settle things.

00:19:14.737 --> 00:19:16.405
I said we can't do that, Professor!

00:19:26.332 --> 00:19:29.293
Would it be possible for me
to attend the trial?

00:19:30.252 --> 00:19:34.048
You're not required to appear,
but you can if you'd like.

00:19:34.131 --> 00:19:36.509
Then, I'll see you at the trial.

00:19:36.592 --> 00:19:38.386
Please don't tell Mr. Kim.

00:19:40.429 --> 00:19:41.514
All right, then.

00:19:46.102 --> 00:19:49.230
I'm telling you,
I have no way of finding that out.

00:19:49.313 --> 00:19:50.940
You can just sit in on the trial.

00:19:51.524 --> 00:19:53.901
I'll let you know
the courtroom number and time.

00:19:54.902 --> 00:19:57.947
I can't go there during work.
It's not even my case.

00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:00.366
Dad, I'm an office worker too, okay?

00:20:00.449 --> 00:20:02.576
I snuck out just now
and have to get back soon.

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:05.371
If Hanguk Group goes down,
our company goes down with it.

00:20:05.454 --> 00:20:07.039
Hanguk Group makes trillions.

00:20:07.623 --> 00:20:09.125
Losing one trial won't ruin them.

00:20:09.208 --> 00:20:11.001
- That's not so for companies.
- Gosh.

00:20:11.085 --> 00:20:13.838
It's the little things
that pile up and weaken them.

00:20:13.921 --> 00:20:16.298
It's our job to pay attention
to things like these.

00:20:16.382 --> 00:20:18.426
I know you subcontract for Hanguk Group,

00:20:18.509 --> 00:20:20.761
- but this is too much of a fuss.
- As it should be.

00:20:20.845 --> 00:20:22.263
They put food on our table.

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:24.932
Everything you've enjoyed came from them.

00:20:25.015 --> 00:20:26.892
Not anymore. Count me out.

00:20:27.977 --> 00:20:30.938
Wanting out won't make it happen.
We're a family business.

00:20:31.021 --> 00:20:32.440
Family business, my foot.

00:20:33.065 --> 00:20:34.066
Goodness.

00:20:46.537 --> 00:20:48.122
Get your rice cakes!

00:20:48.205 --> 00:20:49.248
For crying out loud.

00:20:49.331 --> 00:20:51.834
- You going around selling rice cakes now?
- You little…

00:20:51.917 --> 00:20:54.086
Who still uses
bojagi wrapping cloth like this?

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:55.588
I'm busy. Move.

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:57.631
Later.

00:21:16.066 --> 00:21:17.651
You look young.

00:21:19.153 --> 00:21:20.279
Thank you.

00:21:20.905 --> 00:21:22.490
Are you really a lawyer?

00:21:22.573 --> 00:21:23.741
- Yes.
- How many years in?

00:21:24.325 --> 00:21:25.326
Me?

00:21:27.203 --> 00:21:29.330
About seven or eight years.

00:21:29.997 --> 00:21:31.832
Really? So you're not a newbie.

00:21:33.083 --> 00:21:34.210
A law school graduate?

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.629
- Yes.
- You must come from money.

00:21:37.296 --> 00:21:38.297
Sorry?

00:21:38.881 --> 00:21:41.383
Nothing. Please keep reading.

00:21:53.729 --> 00:21:55.231
Yes, hello?

00:21:55.314 --> 00:21:57.483
Hello, I'm Attorney Kang Huiji.

00:21:57.566 --> 00:21:59.777
I'm reaching out
through Ms. Kang Jeongyun.

00:22:00.945 --> 00:22:03.364
Yes, I heard. Hello.

00:22:03.447 --> 00:22:05.825
Hello. Whenever we have a medical lawsuit,

00:22:05.908 --> 00:22:07.535
I heard you consult for us.

00:22:07.618 --> 00:22:09.286
Thank you, as always.

00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:12.164
Did you get a chance
to review the footage we sent?

00:22:12.248 --> 00:22:13.582
Yes, I did.

00:22:13.666 --> 00:22:16.210
But there was nothing strange about it.

00:22:16.293 --> 00:22:20.464
His hands seem a little slow,
but some doctors just work slowly.

00:22:21.048 --> 00:22:24.969
- Then, what caused the shock?
- It's usually unpredictable.

00:22:25.052 --> 00:22:26.762
And there are thousands of causes.

00:22:27.304 --> 00:22:30.516
Sudden deaths like this
are beyond what humans can control.

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:36.188
I see. Thank you for your time, Doctor.

00:22:37.815 --> 00:22:38.816
Goodbye.

00:23:00.629 --> 00:23:02.882
We'll proceed with the next case.

00:23:02.965 --> 00:23:07.928
Civil case number 2024-24215,
please step forward.

00:23:09.013 --> 00:23:12.516
Plaintiff, Min Subin.
Defendant, Gonggang Industries.

00:23:16.145 --> 00:23:17.646
I didn't say you could sit.

00:23:20.065 --> 00:23:21.108
I apologize.

00:23:27.907 --> 00:23:29.033
Please be seated.

00:23:31.327 --> 00:23:35.039
Yesterday, we submitted a request
to present financial transaction records.

00:23:35.122 --> 00:23:36.707
Request denied.

00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:39.293
But Your Honor, as I explained,

00:23:39.376 --> 00:23:42.212
the defendant is using the same name
as Gonggang Construction

00:23:42.296 --> 00:23:44.882
and likely mixed
financial transactions with them--

00:23:44.965 --> 00:23:47.676
This court is not an institution
for collecting evidence

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:49.219
of such a broad range.

00:23:49.303 --> 00:23:50.638
Request denied.

00:23:52.681 --> 00:23:54.808
But we've explained why it's necessary--

00:23:54.892 --> 00:23:57.227
Nothing further from either side,
I assume?

00:23:57.311 --> 00:23:58.562
No, Your Honor.

00:23:58.646 --> 00:24:00.314
Then, we'll end proceedings.

00:24:00.856 --> 00:24:03.108
The verdict is set
for the 24th of January…

00:24:24.171 --> 00:24:25.172
That's insane!

00:24:25.255 --> 00:24:26.715
- Damn it, that scared me.
- Right?

00:24:27.883 --> 00:24:31.053
Even if he's not at fault,
someone died and he wants to apologize.

00:24:31.136 --> 00:24:32.805
Isn't wrong to stop that?

00:24:32.888 --> 00:24:34.765
- That's just plain wrong!
- Right?

00:24:34.848 --> 00:24:37.059
- Maybe the doctor was at fault.
- That's not it.

00:24:37.142 --> 00:24:40.187
He was cleared in the criminal case
with no sign of malpractice.

00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:42.564
There's no risk,
but they won't let him apologize.

00:24:42.648 --> 00:24:44.817
What's diverticulitis? Could you explain?

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:46.068
Sanggi, look.

00:24:47.528 --> 00:24:50.531
Let me show you.
If your colon is shaped like this…

00:24:50.614 --> 00:24:52.658
The small, bulging pouches
are diverticula.

00:24:52.741 --> 00:24:55.077
They're prone to inflammation
and perforation,

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:57.413
so they usually remove them
with laparoscopy.

00:24:57.496 --> 00:24:59.373
But inflammation means open surgery.

00:24:59.456 --> 00:25:01.417
Wait, how do you even know that?

00:25:04.461 --> 00:25:07.047
What? You said to help
if you didn't know something.

00:25:07.131 --> 00:25:09.216
But I knew very well this time.

00:25:09.299 --> 00:25:10.592
Don't empathize.

00:25:10.676 --> 00:25:12.344
It's just work.

00:25:12.428 --> 00:25:15.431
If you empathize, you'll lose objectivity
and hinder your work.

00:25:16.015 --> 00:25:19.226
Juhyeong, stop pretending like
you're choosing not to empathize.

00:25:19.309 --> 00:25:21.729
You don't empathize,
because you can't feel anything.

00:25:21.812 --> 00:25:23.188
It's not by choice, okay?

00:25:24.857 --> 00:25:27.151
You two are bantering a lot more now.

00:25:27.234 --> 00:25:28.777
I thought we'd gotten closer.

00:25:28.861 --> 00:25:30.612
Yeah, I am closer with you.

00:25:30.696 --> 00:25:31.905
- Right?
- Yeah.

00:25:34.783 --> 00:25:35.951
Did you just wink?

00:25:36.035 --> 00:25:38.245
- Want one too?
- This day's been so brutal.

00:25:43.834 --> 00:25:44.835
Goddamn it.

00:25:44.918 --> 00:25:46.587
- Wet wipes.
- Wet wipes.

00:25:48.005 --> 00:25:49.006
Hey, use this first.

00:25:49.089 --> 00:25:50.090
- In the back.
- Hey.

00:26:14.448 --> 00:26:15.699
Yes?

00:26:18.118 --> 00:26:20.913
Ma'am, I just got back
from the verdict for Kang Yungu's case.

00:26:20.996 --> 00:26:23.082
We won 650 million won.

00:26:23.832 --> 00:26:26.585
- Really? That's a relief.
- Yes.

00:26:26.668 --> 00:26:28.921
I'll let you know
once the judgment's delivered.

00:26:29.004 --> 00:26:30.380
- Okay, thank you.
- Sure.

00:26:35.719 --> 00:26:37.054
At least that's good news.

00:26:42.184 --> 00:26:43.310
KANG YUNGU

00:26:45.687 --> 00:26:47.189
- Hello?
- Did you hear the verdict?

00:26:47.272 --> 00:26:50.984
- Yes, I did. Thankfully--
- Why is it only 650 million won?

00:26:51.068 --> 00:26:53.821
I filed for 700 million won.
Where's the rest?

00:26:53.904 --> 00:26:58.408
About that.
The 50 million was confirmed as repaid.

00:26:58.492 --> 00:27:00.953
We planned to reduce
that part of the claim anyway--

00:27:01.036 --> 00:27:02.621
I said I didn't get that money.

00:27:03.956 --> 00:27:06.583
You received the 50 million
and it's all on record.

00:27:06.667 --> 00:27:09.128
What are you going to do
about the 50 million won?

00:27:11.797 --> 00:27:15.342
Mr. Kang,
out of the 700 million we claimed,

00:27:15.425 --> 00:27:19.638
about 400 million
had no direct evidence of--

00:27:19.721 --> 00:27:23.392
If the court recognized all 700 million,
why did we only win 650 million?

00:27:23.475 --> 00:27:25.936
Why did you lose 50 million won? Why?

00:27:35.529 --> 00:27:37.656
- Attorney Ahn.
- Yes, what is it?

00:27:40.909 --> 00:27:41.994
What? Are you hungry?

00:27:43.495 --> 00:27:44.788
No, it's not that.

00:27:52.212 --> 00:27:54.298
- Here.
- I said it's not that.

00:28:14.026 --> 00:28:15.235
Want to grab drinks later?

00:28:15.319 --> 00:28:17.279
Are you an alcoholic? Give it a rest.

00:28:18.238 --> 00:28:19.239
Okay.

00:28:24.745 --> 00:28:26.204
Thank you for the snack.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.460
When do you want to grab dinner?

00:28:31.543 --> 00:28:32.920
I have dinner plans.

00:28:34.504 --> 00:28:35.547
Everyone's busy.

00:28:37.132 --> 00:28:38.216
Got it. Bye.

00:28:58.236 --> 00:29:00.781
Something feels off.

00:29:02.282 --> 00:29:03.575
What could it be?

00:29:07.829 --> 00:29:09.039
MEDICAL RECORD

00:29:15.545 --> 00:29:16.755
PERFORATION

00:29:29.518 --> 00:29:32.187
Attorney Bae, did we lose Mr. Kang's case?

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:33.814
Sorry? Lose his case?

00:29:33.897 --> 00:29:36.024
Yes, Mr. Kang is in an uproar right now.

00:29:37.526 --> 00:29:40.946
Sir, we won 650 million
out of 700 million.

00:29:41.029 --> 00:29:43.156
Then, why is he going nuts
and saying we lost?

00:29:43.824 --> 00:29:44.992
I have no idea either.

00:29:45.075 --> 00:29:47.786
It was confirmed the 50 million
was already repaid,

00:29:47.869 --> 00:29:51.373
- so we suggested reducing the claim--
- Got it. Let's talk again tomorrow.

00:30:03.301 --> 00:30:05.012
ATTORNEY BAE MUNJEONG

00:30:06.013 --> 00:30:09.474
ATTORNEY HA SANGGI

00:30:12.477 --> 00:30:14.896
Couldn't this be seen
as another person's life?

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:18.900
Lately, the courts have been narrowing
their definition of another person's life

00:30:18.984 --> 00:30:20.360
- in breach of trust cases.
- No.

00:30:20.444 --> 00:30:22.946
- No, look at this clause right here.
- Here?

00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:24.489
{\an8}- This one?
- No, here.

00:30:25.532 --> 00:30:27.117
I didn't see this before.

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:28.243
Cheers.

00:30:32.205 --> 00:30:34.374
By the way, are you really a lawyer?

00:30:34.458 --> 00:30:35.584
Truth is, I'm not.

00:30:36.376 --> 00:30:38.128
- What?
- I'm a K-pop idol.

00:30:38.962 --> 00:30:41.256
- Come on.
- It's the truth.

00:30:41.339 --> 00:30:43.425
I wasn't a famous K-pop idol.

00:30:43.508 --> 00:30:44.551
But I really was one.

00:30:44.634 --> 00:30:47.429
And one day, I thought about
giving studying a shot and--

00:30:47.512 --> 00:30:49.765
MUNJEONG

00:31:00.901 --> 00:31:02.027
Bastards.

00:31:03.278 --> 00:31:05.489
They're never around
when you actually need them.

00:31:32.057 --> 00:31:34.392
Let's finish this up tomorrow.

00:31:34.476 --> 00:31:36.770
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay.

00:31:37.979 --> 00:31:40.607
If you don't have any plans,
do you want to grab a beer?

00:31:44.236 --> 00:31:46.279
Well, are you buying?

00:31:47.656 --> 00:31:48.657
Of course.

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:51.409
- In that case, sounds good.
- Okay.

00:31:51.993 --> 00:31:54.079
I'll go wrap up then, ma'am.

00:31:54.162 --> 00:31:55.330
- Okay.
- All right.

00:31:58.542 --> 00:32:01.378
Ma'am, my hands are full.
Could you open the door for me?

00:32:12.305 --> 00:32:13.306
Okay.

00:32:14.224 --> 00:32:15.934
She didn't even open the door for me.

00:32:24.067 --> 00:32:25.068
Gosh.

00:32:29.865 --> 00:32:31.700
ATTORNEY BAE MUNJEONG

00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:35.453
ATTORNEY BAE MUNJEONG

00:32:35.537 --> 00:32:37.205
- Call me when you get home.
- Okay.

00:32:46.339 --> 00:32:47.507
Is everyone busy?

00:32:47.591 --> 00:32:49.009
You're not the only busy ones.

00:32:49.092 --> 00:32:50.468
Ptooey! Screw you.

00:32:57.475 --> 00:33:00.812
ATTORNEY AHN JUHYEONG

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:07.360
ATTORNEY BAE MUNJEONG

00:34:07.462 --> 00:34:08.546
Let's go now.

00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:11.591
Let's go.

00:34:25.689 --> 00:34:27.524
- You're always here late--
- My goodness!

00:34:28.108 --> 00:34:29.734
Oh dear, I'm sorry.

00:34:29.818 --> 00:34:31.444
Hello, Ms. Kim.

00:34:32.028 --> 00:34:34.197
- Are you going home now?
- Yes.

00:34:34.948 --> 00:34:37.492
But what are you doing here at this hour?

00:34:37.575 --> 00:34:41.621
Well, I was just on a little patrol.

00:34:43.832 --> 00:34:47.961
No one told you to do that, right?

00:34:48.545 --> 00:34:51.923
No, that's not it. I just felt like it.
It's mine, after all.

00:34:53.341 --> 00:34:54.509
Yours?

00:34:54.592 --> 00:34:55.593
Well…

00:34:56.136 --> 00:34:58.888
The company and the building are all mine.

00:35:01.933 --> 00:35:02.934
Hyungmin Building.

00:35:04.269 --> 00:35:05.478
Kim Hyungmin.

00:35:07.856 --> 00:35:09.190
- I see!
- Yes.

00:35:12.193 --> 00:35:14.237
Okay, get home safe.

00:35:14.321 --> 00:35:15.322
Thank you.

00:35:15.905 --> 00:35:18.241
Feel free to swing by my office next time.

00:35:18.992 --> 00:35:20.035
Yes, I will.

00:35:20.118 --> 00:35:21.620
- Okay.
- I'll get going.

00:36:04.037 --> 00:36:05.288
I'm off.

00:36:06.122 --> 00:36:08.458
- Hey, aren't you going to eat?
- Nope.

00:36:21.471 --> 00:36:22.847
Damn it.

00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:02.846
Wake up and get ready for work.

00:37:28.621 --> 00:37:29.664
Okay.

00:37:38.381 --> 00:37:39.716
It's my day off today.

00:37:41.593 --> 00:37:42.594
Day off?

00:37:42.677 --> 00:37:44.763
Yeah.

00:38:31.851 --> 00:38:33.937
How long are you going to
sulk like that for?

00:38:35.939 --> 00:38:37.273
What's everyone so busy with?

00:38:38.066 --> 00:38:40.485
Sorry, I saw your message late last night.

00:38:41.361 --> 00:38:44.155
Let's not call coworkers late at night.

00:38:44.239 --> 00:38:45.824
Or I'll report you for harassment.

00:38:45.907 --> 00:38:47.992
Since when are we coworkers?

00:38:48.535 --> 00:38:49.994
We work at the same company now.

00:38:50.745 --> 00:38:53.873
Hey, I begged like crazy,
but you wouldn't drink with me.

00:38:53.957 --> 00:38:54.958
How are we coworkers?

00:38:55.041 --> 00:38:57.085
You can just have drinks
with your husband.

00:38:57.168 --> 00:38:58.211
He's no fun.

00:38:58.294 --> 00:38:59.712
- He's not?
- Nope.

00:38:59.796 --> 00:39:01.673
Do you all know him?

00:39:01.756 --> 00:39:04.425
Not all of us.
He's Juhyeong's high school friend.

00:39:04.509 --> 00:39:05.927
Still, they're a good match.

00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:08.054
That's why I introduced them
to each other.

00:39:08.137 --> 00:39:10.890
They hit it off, got married,
and are still doing well now.

00:39:10.974 --> 00:39:12.684
- Happily together.
- All lovey-dovey.

00:39:12.767 --> 00:39:14.352
- As they chit-chat.
- Cut the crap.

00:39:15.603 --> 00:39:16.771
Good match, my foot.

00:39:20.483 --> 00:39:23.194
You're expressing exhaustion
with every fiber of your being.

00:39:23.278 --> 00:39:24.612
Did you work late last night?

00:39:24.696 --> 00:39:26.865
Yes, I was looking into that medical case.

00:39:26.948 --> 00:39:29.701
You said the surgery went fine.
Why keep digging?

00:39:29.784 --> 00:39:31.411
I know,

00:39:31.494 --> 00:39:33.538
but something just keeps feeling off.

00:39:34.247 --> 00:39:36.291
Gut feeling is a science too, you know.

00:39:36.374 --> 00:39:38.918
How is that a science?
It's just a feeling.

00:39:39.002 --> 00:39:41.796
No, gut feeling is based on big data.

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:45.842
Your gut feeling emerges
from your lifetime of experiences.

00:39:47.135 --> 00:39:48.803
I didn't know it had a philosophy.

00:39:48.887 --> 00:39:52.557
No, Munjeong.
This is what you call insight.

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:53.641
She knows her stuff.

00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:57.103
No.

00:39:57.186 --> 00:39:58.396
No, you have to fist bump.

00:39:58.479 --> 00:40:00.899
- Geez.
- You're kicking up dust here.

00:40:00.982 --> 00:40:02.734
- Why use your palm?
- Anyway,

00:40:02.817 --> 00:40:06.362
are you two going to
keep speaking formally to each other?

00:40:08.114 --> 00:40:11.200
No, I can drop the honorifics.
But he doesn't, so I don't either.

00:40:11.284 --> 00:40:13.620
You don't use it for the right people.

00:40:13.703 --> 00:40:14.871
Who don't I use it for?

00:40:14.954 --> 00:40:16.998
I wonder who. Who could it be?

00:40:18.833 --> 00:40:20.627
With me, you punk.

00:40:21.169 --> 00:40:23.713
- You were born early in the year.
- But I'm still older.

00:40:23.796 --> 00:40:25.548
I'm an early '90. You're an early '91.

00:40:25.632 --> 00:40:28.551
Right. And Munjeong is a '90,
so we're considered the same age.

00:40:28.635 --> 00:40:31.846
Munjeong is a '90. You're an early '90,
so you two are the same age.

00:40:31.930 --> 00:40:33.848
Then, us three are the same age. Right?

00:40:33.932 --> 00:40:36.309
You are some kind of lunatic.

00:40:36.392 --> 00:40:38.686
Look, Munjeong calls me oppa
to show I'm older.

00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:41.814
For someone all about logic,
why are you suddenly acting dumb?

00:40:41.898 --> 00:40:44.359
What about Sanggi then?
He's an '89, so he's my age.

00:40:44.442 --> 00:40:45.818
Does that make you two equal?

00:40:45.902 --> 00:40:47.028
You little punk.

00:40:47.111 --> 00:40:50.448
Come on, that doesn't make sense.
I'm not that rude.

00:40:51.407 --> 00:40:52.492
Enough with that.

00:40:53.242 --> 00:40:56.245
You and Huiji should drop the formalities
and speak casually.

00:40:57.121 --> 00:40:58.122
Would you like to?

00:40:58.957 --> 00:41:00.875
Go ahead if you wish. I'll do as I please.

00:41:01.542 --> 00:41:03.461
Are you sure? Fine, don't regret it.

00:41:04.837 --> 00:41:05.922
Good.

00:41:06.005 --> 00:41:09.676
- We're not going full casual, right?
- I'm not that rude either.

00:41:10.802 --> 00:41:13.429
Then, do you want her
to call you oppa now?

00:41:13.513 --> 00:41:15.056
What? Oppa.

00:41:15.932 --> 00:41:18.309
Juhyeong oppa. Oppa.

00:41:19.435 --> 00:41:20.436
He likes it.

00:41:22.021 --> 00:41:24.524
He liked it. He does.

00:41:32.115 --> 00:41:34.993
GRANDPA SANGGI

00:41:35.076 --> 00:41:36.744
Did you have a rough day yesterday?

00:41:37.662 --> 00:41:40.289
CHANGWON OPPA

00:41:40.373 --> 00:41:43.126
I'm free today. Let's grab a drink.

00:41:44.836 --> 00:41:46.671
HUIJI

00:41:46.754 --> 00:41:49.549
Good food always makes you feel better.

00:41:53.553 --> 00:41:55.388
{\an8}It's too late, you punks.

00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:58.349
IT'S TOO LATE, YOU PUNKS

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:01.644
My goodness.

00:42:03.896 --> 00:42:05.231
What's got you so down?

00:42:07.984 --> 00:42:11.821
Well, I asked you to grab drinks,
and you called me an alcoholic.

00:42:11.904 --> 00:42:12.947
Hey.

00:42:13.031 --> 00:42:15.700
Next time, spell it out
so I can understand properly.

00:42:15.783 --> 00:42:17.076
Later.

00:42:19.203 --> 00:42:20.204
Goodness.

00:42:41.225 --> 00:42:44.812
Attorney Kang,
did Professor Ku go to the trial today?

00:42:44.896 --> 00:42:48.775
I told him not to, but his phone's off
and he's not at the hospital.

00:42:48.858 --> 00:42:50.068
I think he went anyway.

00:42:51.277 --> 00:42:52.570
Hello, Mr. Kim.

00:42:52.653 --> 00:42:54.072
Hello, Attorney Kang.

00:42:55.323 --> 00:42:59.577
I haven't left the office yet,
so I'm not sure.

00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:02.371
I'll check after the trial
and get back to you.

00:43:03.623 --> 00:43:04.624
All right.

00:43:07.919 --> 00:43:09.587
Then, I'll see you at the trial.

00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:11.547
Please don't tell Mr. Kim.

00:43:20.890 --> 00:43:22.558
The plaintiff Kim Sanggu

00:43:22.642 --> 00:43:26.187
is the father
of the late Kim Geunhwan, correct?

00:43:32.235 --> 00:43:33.277
Yes, Your Honor.

00:43:34.695 --> 00:43:36.489
Let's start with your complaint.

00:43:36.572 --> 00:43:39.117
I see you've submitted
an additional brief today?

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:42.495
Yes, I also submitted
some video and photo evidence.

00:43:42.578 --> 00:43:44.288
I apologize for the late submission.

00:43:44.372 --> 00:43:46.332
Defense counsel,
have you reviewed this?

00:43:46.916 --> 00:43:48.376
No, I have not.

00:43:48.459 --> 00:43:49.544
What's the plan?

00:43:50.753 --> 00:43:55.174
Would you prefer to respond
to this brief next time?

00:43:57.844 --> 00:43:59.804
We'll acknowledge receipt for now.

00:44:00.888 --> 00:44:03.349
All right. Then, please sign that.

00:44:04.809 --> 00:44:05.810
Plaintiff's counsel,

00:44:06.644 --> 00:44:09.105
since it came in today,
we haven't reviewed it yet.

00:44:09.188 --> 00:44:11.440
Could you walk us through it briefly?

00:44:11.941 --> 00:44:15.194
Yes, Your Honor.
Could you pull up Exhibit 8, please?

00:44:16.696 --> 00:44:19.448
The defendant, Ku Dongkyun,
attended a tennis tournament

00:44:19.532 --> 00:44:20.908
held at an alumni event.

00:44:22.368 --> 00:44:24.245
Could you please pause it there?

00:44:24.328 --> 00:44:27.540
As you can see, the defendant
is swinging with his left hand.

00:44:29.458 --> 00:44:31.669
Please pull up Exhibit 9, please.

00:44:39.844 --> 00:44:40.845
Left-handed.

00:44:40.928 --> 00:44:42.680
- He's left-handed.
- Yes.

00:44:43.472 --> 00:44:44.849
The defendant is left-handed.

00:44:45.975 --> 00:44:47.351
But in the surgery footage,

00:44:48.561 --> 00:44:49.937
the surgeon is right-handed.

00:44:50.563 --> 00:44:52.648
The defendant
did not perform this surgery.

00:44:53.399 --> 00:44:55.735
He had someone else operate in his place.

00:44:55.818 --> 00:44:57.111
ALLEGATION OF GHOST SURGERY

00:45:10.583 --> 00:45:11.584
Defense counsel.

00:45:12.335 --> 00:45:13.711
- Yes, Your Honor?
- I believe

00:45:13.794 --> 00:45:17.173
we'll need a detailed response to this.

00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:21.761
We'll review this
and submit a written statement.

00:45:26.474 --> 00:45:27.725
What is the matter?

00:45:27.808 --> 00:45:29.518
We're here to make an arrest.

00:45:29.602 --> 00:45:30.645
That's him.

00:45:35.775 --> 00:45:37.860
You're suspected
of assaulting Ku Dongkyun.

00:45:37.944 --> 00:45:39.237
You'll need to come with us.

00:45:44.909 --> 00:45:48.162
Sir, I'll leave the rest of the trial
in your hands.

00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:07.473
Strap him in.

00:46:07.556 --> 00:46:09.850
- Excuse me, could you help us?
- Yes.

00:46:13.229 --> 00:46:16.857
Thankfully, it's just a mild concussion.
They say he should wake up soon.

00:46:18.734 --> 00:46:20.528
Why did he go there in the first place?

00:46:26.575 --> 00:46:29.120
Mr. Kim, the deputy director
is asking for you.

00:46:29.829 --> 00:46:31.289
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

00:46:42.341 --> 00:46:44.051
PROFESSOR KU DONGKYUN

00:46:59.066 --> 00:47:01.777
- He's left-handed.
- Yes, the defendant is left-handed.

00:47:02.653 --> 00:47:04.155
But in the surgery footage,

00:47:04.739 --> 00:47:06.198
the surgeon is right-handed.

00:47:13.497 --> 00:47:15.333
This is why something felt off.

00:47:17.126 --> 00:47:19.253
{\an8}The defendant
did not perform this surgery.

00:47:19.337 --> 00:47:21.339
He had someone else operate in his place.

00:47:21.422 --> 00:47:23.507
Can't I just apologize

00:47:23.591 --> 00:47:25.968
- and end this with a settlement?
- Professor.

00:47:27.136 --> 00:47:28.804
You said you would stop saying that.

00:47:28.888 --> 00:47:30.681
Either way, someone died, Mr. Kim!

00:47:45.112 --> 00:47:46.155
{\an8}AHN JUHYEONG

00:48:28.364 --> 00:48:30.825
- Are you going home?
- Yes. But you're not?

00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:33.202
I see. Good luck.

00:48:33.285 --> 00:48:34.537
Thanks.

00:48:45.423 --> 00:48:47.675
Didn't you say you'd drop
the honorifics with me?

00:48:47.758 --> 00:48:48.759
You're not going to?

00:48:50.177 --> 00:48:51.846
- No.
- I see.

00:48:57.143 --> 00:48:58.310
Need help with something?

00:49:00.187 --> 00:49:01.188
Yes.

00:49:11.824 --> 00:49:15.077
Well, this is how everyone works,
isn't it?

00:49:16.328 --> 00:49:17.830
I didn't complain.

00:49:21.876 --> 00:49:24.753
- It turns out it was a ghost surgery.
- A ghost surgery?

00:49:26.922 --> 00:49:29.508
The opposing side
submitted a brief the day of,

00:49:29.592 --> 00:49:32.219
and I was absolutely blindsided in court.

00:49:37.808 --> 00:49:39.351
Show me the surgery footage.

00:49:43.105 --> 00:49:44.315
It's this one.

00:50:03.250 --> 00:50:06.587
So, if you look here,
the surgeon is right-handed,

00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:09.173
but a bunch of evidence shows
the doctor's left-handed.

00:50:09.924 --> 00:50:11.133
What did the doctor say?

00:50:12.343 --> 00:50:15.846
I haven't talked to him yet.
He's unconscious and was hospitalized.

00:50:16.722 --> 00:50:19.808
On the way to court,
the victim's family ambushed him.

00:50:22.895 --> 00:50:25.731
Then, once the doctor wakes up,
we'll know for sure.

00:50:25.814 --> 00:50:27.399
What's the problem then?

00:50:30.736 --> 00:50:32.947
This whole situation is distressing.

00:50:36.951 --> 00:50:38.118
So,

00:50:38.202 --> 00:50:40.579
you want to believe
your client's innocent, right?

00:50:40.663 --> 00:50:42.915
How could I believe that now?

00:50:42.998 --> 00:50:44.333
Then, why are you distressed?

00:50:45.668 --> 00:50:48.212
Just accept it as is.
Then, it won't bother you.

00:50:48.295 --> 00:50:52.424
I'm trying to accept it as is.
That process is what's distressing.

00:50:53.050 --> 00:50:54.343
You've never felt that way?

00:50:58.556 --> 00:50:59.557
Geez.

00:51:02.142 --> 00:51:04.103
Do you know what you do
in times like these?

00:51:04.186 --> 00:51:06.188
- What?
- Let's eat something first.

00:51:06.897 --> 00:51:09.942
Continuing to sit here
won't help you focus on anything anyway.

00:51:12.403 --> 00:51:13.404
I'm starving.

00:51:14.154 --> 00:51:15.906
- Got anything to eat?
- Not at all.

00:51:16.824 --> 00:51:17.825
Let's go out and eat.

00:52:34.902 --> 00:52:35.986
Sorry.

00:55:05.677 --> 00:55:06.678
Thank you.

00:56:12.828 --> 00:56:13.829
Man, I'm hungry.

00:56:56.538 --> 00:56:57.581
Do you…

00:56:59.333 --> 00:57:00.417
want to grab a bite?

00:57:05.714 --> 00:57:07.799
How do you not have any emergency snacks?

00:57:09.426 --> 00:57:10.761
And you do?

00:57:11.470 --> 00:57:12.471
Of course, I do.

00:57:12.554 --> 00:57:14.890
You need things like energy bars
and chocolate bars

00:57:14.973 --> 00:57:16.391
when your energy drops at work.

00:57:17.559 --> 00:57:19.061
I didn't expect that from you.

00:57:39.456 --> 00:57:41.917
You don't have to accept
that it was a ghost surgery.

00:57:44.336 --> 00:57:46.004
You told me to accept it earlier.

00:57:46.088 --> 00:57:47.297
You said it bothered you.

00:57:49.257 --> 00:57:53.178
Okay, what you need to accept is
the doctor is left-handed.

00:57:53.261 --> 00:57:55.639
And the surgeon is right-handed.
That's all.

00:57:55.722 --> 00:57:57.307
Because you have proof.

00:57:57.391 --> 00:57:59.976
But there's no proof
that it was a ghost surgery.

00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:03.397
It was a ghost surgery.
They logically proved it.

00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:05.440
Sure, logically right
based on common sense.

00:58:05.524 --> 00:58:06.942
But that's our common sense.

00:58:11.446 --> 00:58:12.489
My goodness!

00:58:15.742 --> 00:58:17.411
- Who's that?
- Munjeong's husband.

00:58:17.494 --> 00:58:19.830
He works as a scrub nurse
at a university hospital.

00:58:20.664 --> 00:58:21.665
Hello.

00:58:24.668 --> 00:58:26.378
- Are you done?
- Yes.

00:58:26.461 --> 00:58:27.754
Let's head up.

00:58:39.182 --> 00:58:40.851
How do you explain this?

00:58:44.187 --> 00:58:46.356
It's like…

00:58:48.233 --> 00:58:51.611
dragging a friend out
in the middle of the night

00:58:51.695 --> 00:58:52.863
for no real reason.

00:58:53.447 --> 00:58:54.448
What?

00:58:55.031 --> 00:58:58.243
All left-handed surgeons operate
with their right hands.

00:58:58.326 --> 00:59:00.245
I bet they can't operate left-handed.

00:59:00.328 --> 00:59:03.123
Does that make sense though?

00:59:04.583 --> 00:59:06.752
To the general public, maybe not.

00:59:06.835 --> 00:59:08.962
But for us, it's common knowledge.

00:59:10.213 --> 00:59:12.632
Hey, kindly explain it a bit more.

00:59:12.716 --> 00:59:14.551
Got it.
Okay, let me break it down.

00:59:18.346 --> 00:59:19.639
Your first time assisting?

00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:23.518
Yes. I'll do my best.

00:59:23.602 --> 00:59:26.855
Surgical training is basically
old-school apprenticeship.

00:59:26.938 --> 00:59:28.106
Scalpel.

00:59:30.108 --> 00:59:32.027
But since things are passed down that way,

00:59:32.110 --> 00:59:33.945
some things never change.

00:59:36.114 --> 00:59:37.824
- Are you left-handed?
- Yes, Professor.

00:59:39.576 --> 00:59:40.952
Didn't your seniors tell you?

00:59:41.036 --> 00:59:42.120
What do you mean, sir?

00:59:42.204 --> 00:59:44.080
Your hands bump
while facing each other,

00:59:44.164 --> 00:59:46.625
so you have to match
your mentor's dominant hand.

00:59:46.708 --> 00:59:47.751
Usually, the right.

00:59:50.504 --> 00:59:53.006
Hey. If you can only use
your left hand, get out.

00:59:53.089 --> 00:59:54.841
- I'm sorry. I'll do it again.
- Get out.

00:59:55.842 --> 00:59:58.178
That's why most surgeons
operate right-handed

00:59:58.261 --> 01:00:00.388
even if they're left-handed.

01:00:00.472 --> 01:00:02.265
Or they become ambidextrous.

01:00:03.850 --> 01:00:06.812
Anyways, suspecting a ghost surgery
just because of this

01:00:06.895 --> 01:00:08.063
doesn't hold up.

01:00:11.399 --> 01:00:12.734
Did that help?

01:00:13.401 --> 01:00:14.402
Yes.

01:00:15.946 --> 01:00:16.947
You can go now.

01:00:18.865 --> 01:00:20.951
- What?
- Go.

01:00:21.618 --> 01:00:24.287
What am I, your pet?

01:00:24.371 --> 01:00:26.540
Yanking me around
like I'm on a leash.

01:00:26.623 --> 01:00:28.792
So I'll go, but you owe me a meal.

01:00:28.875 --> 01:00:31.127
- Okay. Go.
- I'll ask for a fancy meal.

01:00:31.211 --> 01:00:32.963
Thanks! That meals on me.

01:00:33.046 --> 01:00:35.423
It's okay.
He'll just owe me something fancy.

01:00:35.507 --> 01:00:36.633
- Thank you.
- See you.

01:00:36.716 --> 01:00:37.717
- Bye.
- Later.

01:00:44.015 --> 01:00:46.017
You owe me a meal instead.

01:00:47.394 --> 01:00:48.854
Should I buy Munjeong a meal?

01:00:52.691 --> 01:00:55.360
Just kidding.
I'll treat you to one. Thanks.

01:00:57.696 --> 01:00:59.656
Okay, everything's sorted.

01:01:00.574 --> 01:01:01.658
Are you that happy?

01:01:01.741 --> 01:01:03.577
Of course, I am!

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:07.539
My client's not some terrible person.
That's such a relief.

01:01:08.039 --> 01:01:10.250
It's always better
if they turn out to be decent.

01:01:14.421 --> 01:01:15.422
Let's head out.

01:01:16.673 --> 01:01:17.716
Sure.

01:01:55.962 --> 01:01:56.963
Come in.

01:01:59.758 --> 01:02:03.470
Mr. Na said to assign this case to you.

01:02:03.553 --> 01:02:04.888
Okay, you can leave it there.

01:02:06.139 --> 01:02:07.140
Okay.

01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:36.378
{\an8}PETITION
COUNTERCLAIM

01:02:39.172 --> 01:02:40.465
A divorce.

01:02:52.769 --> 01:02:56.189
What are you doing?
You should've knocked first.

01:02:57.399 --> 01:03:01.027
I was just taking a five-minute break.

01:03:01.111 --> 01:03:03.363
I was going to get back to work
after one comic.

01:03:04.656 --> 01:03:05.824
Sure, if you say so.

01:03:05.907 --> 01:03:08.493
It's not "if you say so."
It's true.

01:03:08.576 --> 01:03:11.413
You always pop in whenever I take
a quick five-minute break.

01:03:11.496 --> 01:03:13.164
All right. I didn't say anything.

01:03:13.707 --> 01:03:15.834
Anyways, you want to switch cases with me?

01:03:17.961 --> 01:03:18.962
Switch cases?

01:03:19.045 --> 01:03:21.256
You said the sale proceeds case
was tough, right?

01:03:21.339 --> 01:03:23.008
I'll trade you for a divorce case.

01:03:23.091 --> 01:03:25.176
Sure. Did you clear it with Mr. Na?

01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:26.553
I was just about to.

01:03:27.971 --> 01:03:30.306
But what gives?
You want to swap cases?

01:03:32.767 --> 01:03:35.020
Well, you'll find out
once you start on it.

01:03:35.103 --> 01:03:36.855
- So it's a deal?
- Yeah.

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:43.570
He really hates taking divorce cases.

01:03:48.074 --> 01:03:50.035
- Sir, can I come in?
- Yes, come in.

01:03:57.792 --> 01:04:00.920
Sir, it's about the divorce case
you assigned me.

01:04:01.004 --> 01:04:02.797
The Cha Jeongho case?

01:04:02.881 --> 01:04:04.632
- Yes, sir.
- Okay, what about it?

01:04:04.716 --> 01:04:07.302
I haven't done divorce cases in a while.

01:04:07.385 --> 01:04:08.386
- Right.
- And usually,

01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:10.638
clients prefer
female attorneys with divorces.

01:04:15.852 --> 01:04:18.271
Since when do you say
you don't want to do something?

01:04:19.731 --> 01:04:21.941
It's not that I don't want to do it.

01:04:22.025 --> 01:04:24.778
- For various reasons, instead of--
- I get what you're saying.

01:04:24.861 --> 01:04:27.197
But the client, Cha Jeongho,

01:04:27.947 --> 01:04:31.701
specifically requested a male attorney,
so we don't have a choice.

01:04:31.785 --> 01:04:36.039
- Then, that just leaves you.
- I see. He asked for a male attorney?

01:04:42.545 --> 01:04:45.256
- Do you want me to do it then?
- No.

01:04:46.591 --> 01:04:47.717
No, I should do it.

01:04:47.801 --> 01:04:49.761
- I appreciate it.
- Yes, sir.

01:05:16.204 --> 01:05:18.414
Right. Work is work.

01:05:29.008 --> 01:05:30.176
How are you feeling?

01:05:30.885 --> 01:05:32.929
I heard you woke up, so I came right away.

01:05:33.847 --> 01:05:36.850
Thank you. I'm feeling much better now.

01:05:37.559 --> 01:05:38.560
That's a relief.

01:05:39.811 --> 01:05:41.688
I heard Kim Sanggu

01:05:42.605 --> 01:05:44.607
claimed it was a ghost surgery?

01:05:45.608 --> 01:05:46.776
Yes.

01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:49.946
But I'm aware left-handed surgeons
often operate right-handed,

01:05:50.446 --> 01:05:53.449
so I can explain that part clearly.

01:05:55.869 --> 01:05:56.995
That's impressive.

01:05:57.829 --> 01:05:59.372
Most people don't know that.

01:06:02.375 --> 01:06:04.669
There was nothing wrong
with the surgery itself.

01:06:04.752 --> 01:06:07.088
But things like this
still seemed to happen.

01:06:08.381 --> 01:06:09.507
Every time it happens,

01:06:10.341 --> 01:06:13.553
I wonder if I'm actually saving lives
through surgery.

01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:16.389
If their deaths aren't my fault,

01:06:16.472 --> 01:06:19.601
maybe I shouldn't be get credit
for saving their lives either.

01:06:21.477 --> 01:06:23.313
That's why you wanted to apologize.

01:06:24.314 --> 01:06:26.065
But mustering the courage wasn't easy.

01:06:27.901 --> 01:06:30.111
I saw the look on your face back then.

01:06:30.195 --> 01:06:34.199
But an apology could be used
as evidence of negligence.

01:06:34.282 --> 01:06:36.451
That may not necessarily be the case.

01:06:36.534 --> 01:06:39.662
If there's no other evidence
of surgical malpractice,

01:06:39.746 --> 01:06:42.373
an apology alone isn't enough
to prove liability.

01:06:44.167 --> 01:06:46.169
I thought you'd be relieved
by what I said,

01:06:46.836 --> 01:06:48.338
but you looked surprised.

01:06:49.130 --> 01:06:51.382
I do believe I should apologize,

01:06:52.675 --> 01:06:54.677
but I just can't find
the courage to do it.

01:06:54.761 --> 01:07:00.266
Perhaps, a part of me felt at ease
when Mr. Kim tried to stop me.

01:07:00.350 --> 01:07:02.143
Please think about the hospital too.

01:07:02.227 --> 01:07:04.979
Because then,
it's not that I didn't apologize.

01:07:06.731 --> 01:07:08.399
I was stopped from doing it.

01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:14.113
I actually saw Kim Sanggu
on my way to court that day.

01:07:21.996 --> 01:07:23.289
I saw him.

01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:28.044
I couldn't even face him,
let alone apologize.

01:07:35.301 --> 01:07:36.803
I deserved to get ambushed.

01:07:37.929 --> 01:07:40.682
What's going to happen to him now?

01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:44.686
I heard he returned home.

01:07:45.311 --> 01:07:46.896
But he'll likely be indicted.

01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:47.981
If I…

01:07:49.232 --> 01:07:53.278
agree to settle,
will it reduce his punishment?

01:07:55.571 --> 01:07:56.990
It would.

01:07:58.783 --> 01:07:59.784
I see.

01:08:03.913 --> 01:08:05.164
I'll go with you.

01:08:06.874 --> 01:08:09.252
You'll get the chance
to apologize as well.

01:08:11.546 --> 01:08:12.547
Thank you.

01:08:27.937 --> 01:08:28.938
Mr. Cha Jeongho?

01:08:29.647 --> 01:08:30.690
Yes.

01:08:31.524 --> 01:08:32.525
Hello.

01:08:33.860 --> 01:08:34.861
I'm Cha Jeongho.

01:08:39.615 --> 01:08:40.616
I'm Ahn Juhyeong.

01:08:43.244 --> 01:08:46.414
We've agreed to divorce,

01:08:47.790 --> 01:08:52.587
but we're stuck on alimony
and splitting assets.

01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:55.882
Has a trial date been set?

01:08:55.965 --> 01:08:59.344
Yes, we couldn't settle,
so a trial date's been set.

01:08:59.427 --> 01:09:00.470
I mean,

01:09:01.262 --> 01:09:03.056
we figured buying lawyers

01:09:03.806 --> 01:09:05.725
would only make things messier,

01:09:06.684 --> 01:09:09.729
so we both agreed not to buy them.

01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:12.190
But at this point,

01:09:12.273 --> 01:09:15.818
I felt like I needed to do
what was best for me.

01:09:16.527 --> 01:09:17.779
You said you agreed

01:09:17.862 --> 01:09:20.239
- not to buy lawyers?
- Yes.

01:09:20.323 --> 01:09:22.241
Lawyers aren't things you buy and sell.

01:09:22.325 --> 01:09:23.326
Really?

01:09:25.620 --> 01:09:27.038
That's weird.

01:09:27.121 --> 01:09:29.957
I'm here today to buy a lawyer though.

01:09:33.836 --> 01:09:35.713
Yes, I see.

01:09:35.797 --> 01:09:37.924
Are you far apart on your terms?

01:09:38.007 --> 01:09:39.926
I can't give her a cent.

01:09:40.009 --> 01:09:43.763
Sure, I brought up
getting a divorce first,

01:09:44.847 --> 01:09:47.225
but that doesn't mean
I owe her money, right?

01:09:47.308 --> 01:09:49.060
Then, you don't need to pay alimony.

01:09:49.143 --> 01:09:50.853
I can't give away my assets either.

01:09:52.605 --> 01:09:54.023
We've only been married

01:09:54.774 --> 01:09:56.109
a little over a year.

01:09:56.901 --> 01:09:58.403
It hasn't been that long.

01:09:58.486 --> 01:10:01.447
None of my assets came from that marriage.

01:10:02.156 --> 01:10:05.910
I covered almost
all the wedding expenses myself.

01:10:05.993 --> 01:10:08.246
How much is the other party asking for?

01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:12.667
She wants 10 million won in alimony
and 10 million won in assets.

01:10:16.504 --> 01:10:18.715
Well, it's not actually a lot.

01:10:19.632 --> 01:10:22.301
She just wanted a symbolic number

01:10:22.385 --> 01:10:24.178
since I first proposed the divorce.

01:10:27.515 --> 01:10:30.852
You could've just agreed
and settled this divorce then.

01:10:31.769 --> 01:10:33.020
You're pretty well-off.

01:10:36.607 --> 01:10:37.608
Why should I?

01:10:39.819 --> 01:10:40.987
I'm not backing down.

01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:46.200
We call it personality differences,
but the divorce is basically her fault.

01:10:46.284 --> 01:10:48.453
So you're saying
she has cause for liability?

01:10:49.162 --> 01:10:51.914
Well, not technically
cause for liability, but…

01:10:56.836 --> 01:10:58.713
In any case, we're just incompatible.

01:10:59.297 --> 01:11:00.757
Totally incompatible.

01:11:01.549 --> 01:11:05.386
I'm losing my mind.
I can't live with her anymore.

01:11:05.470 --> 01:11:09.056
Also, it's all on her.

01:11:30.286 --> 01:11:35.583
NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL
PLAINTIFF KIM SANGGU

01:12:03.694 --> 01:12:05.112
- What are you doing here?
- What?

01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:10.743
While heading out,
I was just checking if everyone had left.

01:12:10.827 --> 01:12:13.120
- Are you clocking out?
- Yeah, I am.

01:12:14.163 --> 01:12:16.499
You must be the last one here.

01:12:16.582 --> 01:12:18.751
Yeah, Juhyeong left early today.

01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:20.878
Really?

01:12:20.962 --> 01:12:21.963
Let's go.

01:12:22.046 --> 01:12:23.047
Okay.

01:12:33.182 --> 01:12:36.060
{\an8}SEOUL FAMILY COURT
SEOUL ADMINISTRATIVE COURT

01:13:00.418 --> 01:13:04.463
The 10:50 a.m. case.
Family law case number 2023-3330.

01:13:04.547 --> 01:13:06.048
Are the parties here?

01:13:07.341 --> 01:13:09.135
Are you here for 10:50 a.m. case?

01:13:09.218 --> 01:13:10.887
No, the 11:00 a.m. case.

01:13:10.970 --> 01:13:12.430
Can I wait inside?

01:13:12.513 --> 01:13:16.267
I'm sorry, you can't.
Most family law cases are closed trials.

01:13:16.350 --> 01:13:17.435
They go one at a time.

01:13:17.518 --> 01:13:18.519
Okay.

01:13:18.603 --> 01:13:19.896
Are you the 10:50 a.m. case?

01:13:19.979 --> 01:13:21.856
- Yes.
- Me too.

01:13:21.939 --> 01:13:22.982
Please come in.

01:13:40.458 --> 01:13:43.669
Are the parties here
for the 11:10 a.m. case?

01:13:44.378 --> 01:13:45.504
Yes.

01:13:45.588 --> 01:13:47.131
The 11:10 a.m. case?

01:13:47.965 --> 01:13:48.966
Please come in.

01:14:13.407 --> 01:14:15.117
Who's representing the plaintiff?

01:14:15.201 --> 01:14:16.911
I'm Ahn Juhyeong

01:14:16.994 --> 01:14:19.956
with Law Group Hyungmin,
attorney for plaintiff Cha Jeongho.

01:14:20.039 --> 01:14:22.124
Okay, Attorney Ahn Juhyeong.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.543
Who's representing the defendant?

01:14:32.677 --> 01:14:34.178
Are you the party in question?

01:14:37.682 --> 01:14:38.683
Yes.

01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:40.601
I'm…

01:14:43.396 --> 01:14:44.855
Park Sujeong.

01:15:04.667 --> 01:15:11.340
Law and The City

01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:43.372
Law and The City

01:15:44.165 --> 01:15:46.542
{\an8}Crystal Park is his ex-girlfriend.

01:15:47.293 --> 01:15:50.337
{\an8}Right now, I'm not Ahn Juhyeong.
I'm just Cha Jeongho's attorney.

01:15:50.421 --> 01:15:51.922
{\an8}You should drop the case.

01:15:52.506 --> 01:15:54.800
{\an8}It's nothing big. It's just a quick visit.

01:15:55.843 --> 01:15:58.095
{\an8}Did you assault her?

01:16:00.347 --> 01:16:02.725
{\an8}I looked you up to see
what kind of person you were.

01:16:02.808 --> 01:16:05.853
{\an8}I guess Juhyeong
takes on his friends' cases too.

01:16:05.936 --> 01:16:08.981
{\an8}That's actually
the one type of case he won't do.

01:16:09.065 --> 01:16:10.107
{\an8}Excuse me.

01:16:11.442 --> 01:16:14.612
{\an8}I paid with my money to buy you.

01:16:15.571 --> 01:16:16.822
{\an8}I don't let things slide.

01:16:23.496 --> 01:16:25.498
