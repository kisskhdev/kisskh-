00:00:15.516 --> 00:00:18.060
I didn't get what I wanted in life.

00:00:27.278 --> 00:00:28.654
Order whatever you want.

00:00:39.457 --> 00:00:40.291
This one!

00:00:41.125 --> 00:00:43.169
Really? Why that one?

00:00:43.252 --> 00:00:44.253
HOJICHA SET 350 YEN

00:00:44.336 --> 00:00:48.758
You can order this fruit pancake,
or chocolate banana parfait,

00:00:48.841 --> 00:00:50.676
or whatever you like!

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.428
It's my payday today.

00:00:56.849 --> 00:00:57.683
Excuse me.

00:00:58.434 --> 00:00:59.560
What can I get for you?

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:03.105
-This hojicha set and a water, please.
-Yes.

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:06.025
-Life was difficult for my mother and me.
-Certainly.

00:01:06.108 --> 00:01:07.109
But...

00:01:14.658 --> 00:01:15.493
Here.

00:01:19.663 --> 00:01:21.165
You can have some.

00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:23.167
Thank you.

00:01:24.794 --> 00:01:25.628
Let's eat.

00:01:25.711 --> 00:01:26.712
Let's eat!

00:01:27.797 --> 00:01:30.341
The moment I took a bite
of my sweet treat,

00:01:30.925 --> 00:01:34.512
I really believed it.
That my mother and I were happy.

00:01:41.268 --> 00:01:42.436
You know,

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.482
I used to work part-time at this
restaurant when I was in high school.

00:01:46.565 --> 00:01:50.444
It was my very first job, so I'd mess up
and get yelled at all the time.

00:01:50.528 --> 00:01:52.446
But there was a man from the head office

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.324
who came here for training,
and he always stood up for me.

00:01:56.617 --> 00:01:58.160
He was so kind.

00:02:00.162 --> 00:02:02.498
That man was your mom's first love.

00:02:03.165 --> 00:02:04.166
First love?

00:02:05.501 --> 00:02:07.586
I wonder when your first love will be?

00:02:12.675 --> 00:02:13.509
Haru?

00:02:17.763 --> 00:02:18.764
You remember me?

00:02:18.848 --> 00:02:21.892
My mother and that man,
who were each other's first love...

00:02:22.852 --> 00:02:23.686
...met again...

00:02:24.228 --> 00:02:25.104
This is my son.

00:02:25.187 --> 00:02:26.438
...and fell for each other.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.320
When he heard that my father
wanted to marry my divorced mother,

00:02:33.946 --> 00:02:35.531
Grandpa was furious.

00:02:38.492 --> 00:02:41.662
My father was usually too timid
to go against my grandfather,

00:02:42.538 --> 00:02:46.041
but this time, he stood his ground,
saying he'd move out if he had to.

00:02:47.293 --> 00:02:51.046
My grandfather had no choice but to allow
the marriage, on the condition…

00:02:52.548 --> 00:02:55.092
that their future child would
take over the company.

00:02:56.051 --> 00:02:58.512
It was only a few years later…

00:02:59.972 --> 00:03:02.141
that my mother fell ill.

00:03:05.936 --> 00:03:09.064
Don't forget to be grateful
to your grandfather,

00:03:10.357 --> 00:03:13.819
and repay his kindness in full.

00:03:15.696 --> 00:03:19.033
And your father is too kind
to stand up for himself,

00:03:22.411 --> 00:03:24.496
so be there for him, okay?

00:03:25.998 --> 00:03:30.002
That is… the life my mother wanted for me.

00:03:32.671 --> 00:03:34.548
Have you decided your post-grad plans?

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.761
I think I'll go work
at my grandfather's company.

00:03:40.638 --> 00:03:42.473
You're giving up on being a researcher?

00:03:43.432 --> 00:03:44.808
Think hard before deciding.

00:03:45.392 --> 00:03:47.019
It's your life.

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:58.238
TEITO UNIVERSITY

00:04:03.494 --> 00:04:04.703
Can I help you?

00:04:06.872 --> 00:04:11.168
Oh, well, I came to Tokyo
to see my daughter,

00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:14.672
but I had some time before the meeting,

00:04:14.755 --> 00:04:18.676
so I thought I'd drop by
to see what her school's like.

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:21.303
But where do I go?

00:04:23.222 --> 00:04:26.016
Well, this is no place
for an old man like me.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.685
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

00:04:28.852 --> 00:04:30.270
-Um...
-Huh?

00:04:32.022 --> 00:04:33.816
If you'd like, I can show you around.

00:04:34.358 --> 00:04:35.734
No, no, no…

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:37.653
What?

00:04:39.488 --> 00:04:40.322
This way.

00:04:40.406 --> 00:04:41.573
Are you sure?

00:04:47.913 --> 00:04:48.747
I'll carry those.

00:04:48.831 --> 00:04:50.207
Oh, no, no!

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.084
-Thank you.
-No problem.

00:04:53.335 --> 00:04:54.169
Thank you.

00:04:57.256 --> 00:04:59.591
Well, now, this place sure is fancy.

00:05:02.011 --> 00:05:04.847
And it's so nice on the inside too.

00:05:06.515 --> 00:05:08.267
Oh, excuse me for barging in.

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:11.311
This is the literature classroom.

00:05:11.395 --> 00:05:12.980
Oh, classroom?

00:05:17.192 --> 00:05:20.904
Isn't this building from before the war?

00:05:20.988 --> 00:05:24.700
Yes, though I heard
they did some renovations a few years ago.

00:05:24.783 --> 00:05:28.996
Renovations? Well, history goes on
no matter how we dress things up.

00:05:29.955 --> 00:05:33.250
Wow, there are students
all over the place out here, too!

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:34.960
This is the courtyard.

00:05:35.502 --> 00:05:39.048
After classes, everyone meets
around here to talk and have lunch.

00:05:39.131 --> 00:05:42.676
I see! That's what they're all
doing out here, huh?

00:05:44.553 --> 00:05:45.429
This is the cafeteria.

00:05:45.512 --> 00:05:47.014
Oh, the cafeteria!

00:05:47.097 --> 00:05:49.475
Wow. Such a large cafeteria.

00:05:49.558 --> 00:05:53.270
Do they serve fish here?
My daughter likes fish.

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:56.398
Well, I recommend the mentai butter udon.

00:05:56.482 --> 00:05:58.358
-Mentai butter udon?
-Yes.

00:06:01.278 --> 00:06:02.696
These stacked--

00:06:04.031 --> 00:06:07.034
What are all those things
stacked up there?

00:06:08.577 --> 00:06:10.120
-Those, over there?
-Yes.

00:06:10.204 --> 00:06:12.164
Those are the thesis collections.

00:06:12.247 --> 00:06:13.373
-Thesis?
-Yes.

00:06:13.457 --> 00:06:17.086
I see. I wonder if my daughter
is writing a thesis too?

00:06:18.212 --> 00:06:20.422
Wow.

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:23.759
This is a really nice place.

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:28.263
I guess there's greenery like this
in Tokyo too.

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:36.522
My daughter really likes
the scenery of Toyama.

00:06:38.273 --> 00:06:43.320
Kurobe Gorge, Gokayama,
and the Jinzu Bridge.

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:48.200
On our days off, I would take her
all over the place in the car.

00:06:48.283 --> 00:06:51.453
I never thought she would end up in Tokyo.

00:06:53.622 --> 00:06:55.541
She's a sweet girl.

00:06:56.125 --> 00:06:58.210
I'm afraid she's too nice sometimes.

00:06:59.044 --> 00:07:02.005
It's just been the two of us
for a long time now, you see.

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:04.591
It was the same for me too.

00:07:05.175 --> 00:07:06.593
My mother and I.

00:07:06.677 --> 00:07:08.095
Is that so?

00:07:08.804 --> 00:07:11.223
If so, your mom must be proud of you.

00:07:12.516 --> 00:07:16.270
No... I wasn't able to do
anything for her.

00:07:17.396 --> 00:07:19.815
I couldn't give my mother
the happiness she deserved.

00:07:21.108 --> 00:07:24.319
Nah. Kids don't need
to worry about making their parents happy.

00:07:25.112 --> 00:07:28.157
Your happiness is your mother's happiness.

00:07:30.701 --> 00:07:35.038
I wanted to protect my daughter
at least until she got married,

00:07:35.122 --> 00:07:37.207
but things have started to fall apart.

00:07:44.298 --> 00:07:45.132
TEITO UNIVERSITY

00:07:45.215 --> 00:07:48.177
If you're going to Jimbocho,
you can take the bus from here.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.762
-Oh. I see. Thank you.
-You're welcome.

00:07:50.846 --> 00:07:52.431
And thanks for holding my bags.

00:07:53.432 --> 00:07:56.226
Well, thank you so much for everything.

00:07:57.352 --> 00:08:00.689
I always thought
Tokyo was full of shady guys,

00:08:00.772 --> 00:08:04.026
but it's nice to know there are
decent young men like you out here.

00:08:06.028 --> 00:08:07.738
Oh, and please have some if you'd like.

00:08:07.821 --> 00:08:09.281
-It's okay.
-Toyama fish cakes.

00:08:09.364 --> 00:08:11.074
You brought those for your daughter.

00:08:12.659 --> 00:08:13.911
But thank you.

00:08:13.994 --> 00:08:15.204
Really?

00:08:17.664 --> 00:08:18.999
Well, then...

00:08:19.583 --> 00:08:21.585
I'm sorry, this is all I have.

00:08:22.085 --> 00:08:24.546
Give me your hand. Your hand.

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:26.006
Here.

00:08:27.007 --> 00:08:28.091
Oh, right.

00:08:28.759 --> 00:08:30.135
Do you want to see a picture?

00:08:31.386 --> 00:08:32.387
Let's see.

00:08:33.388 --> 00:08:34.389
Here.

00:08:35.057 --> 00:08:36.683
My daughter. Misa.

00:08:36.767 --> 00:08:38.352
GRADUATION

00:08:41.772 --> 00:08:44.608
Good morning, Kamekichi
Did you eat breakfast?

00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:46.568
Come on! That way!

00:08:46.652 --> 00:08:49.404
Are these oranges?
Do you think they're edible?

00:08:50.614 --> 00:08:52.407
She's pretty, yeah?

00:08:57.913 --> 00:09:00.999
Oh, well. Thanks again.

00:09:02.751 --> 00:09:05.128
You should come visit Toyama sometime.

00:09:07.506 --> 00:09:08.340
All right.

00:09:32.447 --> 00:09:33.657
Huh?

00:09:53.427 --> 00:09:55.512
WINTER-SPRING SEASONAL PRODUCT PROPOSAL

00:10:17.409 --> 00:10:20.996
THANK YOU FOR YOUR HARD WORK

00:10:21.079 --> 00:10:23.665
Everyone, today,

00:10:23.749 --> 00:10:28.420
we are going to decorate
these delicious gingerbread cookies

00:10:28.503 --> 00:10:31.465
and put them on the big tree right here!

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:35.135
Okay, so choose your favorite cookie shape

00:10:35.218 --> 00:10:38.930
and have fun drawing with
the chocolate and sugar pens we have here!

00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:59.910
-Don't give up, Mr. Rabbit!
-Hang in there!

00:11:03.246 --> 00:11:07.501
For some reason, whenever I saw her...

00:11:08.794 --> 00:11:10.253
I felt free.

00:11:20.555 --> 00:11:22.766
-I wanna eat it now!
-Yeah!

00:11:31.108 --> 00:11:32.150
Hello?

00:11:32.234 --> 00:11:35.654
Wataru. Where are you? What are you doing?

00:11:35.737 --> 00:11:36.947
I'm waiting for my car.

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:40.659
It's Christmas Eve,
so you'll be home for dinner, right?

00:11:42.119 --> 00:11:45.080
No, I'm going back to the office.
I'll be a little late.

00:11:45.163 --> 00:11:48.834
Come on, you know you're the only one
working on a day like this.

00:12:01.179 --> 00:12:02.013
For me?

00:12:27.747 --> 00:12:28.707
Thanks.

00:12:30.292 --> 00:12:31.668
Merry Christmas.

00:12:45.056 --> 00:12:46.516
It's the first snow.

00:12:58.236 --> 00:13:02.657
But our lives... never crossed paths.

00:13:05.744 --> 00:13:11.458
SUZUTOYA FIRST HALF-YEAR OPERATING PROFIT
-52,012,607 YEN

00:13:39.569 --> 00:13:41.613
It's not much,
but please enjoy this together.

00:13:41.696 --> 00:13:44.366
Oh, yeah? Really? Thanks, thanks.

00:13:44.449 --> 00:13:46.785
-Thank you.
-Thank you so much.

00:13:46.868 --> 00:13:49.412
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

00:13:50.664 --> 00:13:51.873
You two look good together.

00:13:54.417 --> 00:13:55.919
What is this you brought us?

00:13:56.002 --> 00:13:57.087
They're chocolates.

00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:58.129
Chocolates.

00:13:58.213 --> 00:14:00.215
Let's have a coffee break then.

00:14:00.298 --> 00:14:02.008
-Yes, please.
-Thank you.

00:14:02.092 --> 00:14:03.468
STAFF TRANSFER ANNOUNCEMENT

00:14:03.552 --> 00:14:05.512
WATARU SUZUKI
DIRECTOR OF RESTAURANT OPERATIONS

00:14:05.595 --> 00:14:07.973
2016

00:14:08.056 --> 00:14:09.099
2025

00:14:09.182 --> 00:14:13.937
Suzutoya Holdings has decided to withdraw
from the restaurant business.

00:14:14.688 --> 00:14:16.189
For over 50 years,

00:14:16.815 --> 00:14:23.238
this restaurant has been
a place of comfort for this community.

00:14:25.031 --> 00:14:27.325
And now,
you're just going to tear it down?

00:14:27.409 --> 00:14:29.995
The decline in revenue
caused by the COVID-19 pandemic

00:14:30.078 --> 00:14:31.204
was the decisive factor.

00:14:32.038 --> 00:14:35.750
I sincerely regret
that it turned out this way.

00:14:39.212 --> 00:14:44.050
When you were little,
you used to come here often.

00:14:44.718 --> 00:14:46.052
With your mother.

00:14:46.928 --> 00:14:48.054
This is a real shame.

00:14:55.145 --> 00:14:58.148
Hurry up, Mom.
I want to eat a matcha parfait.

00:15:01.109 --> 00:15:02.485
Director Suzuki.

00:15:03.987 --> 00:15:06.698
You're from the second planning division,
aren't you?

00:15:08.074 --> 00:15:09.034
I'm Sumiyoshi.

00:15:13.788 --> 00:15:15.373
Nice to see you again.

00:15:15.457 --> 00:15:20.045
You too. I left headquarters
a long time ago.

00:15:20.754 --> 00:15:23.715
I heard that you transferred over
to Restaurant Operations.

00:15:23.798 --> 00:15:24.633
Yes.

00:15:25.342 --> 00:15:28.011
How is everyone
at the second planning division?

00:15:29.971 --> 00:15:33.600
Actually, I left the company.

00:15:34.768 --> 00:15:36.978
I have some issues with my health...

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:42.400
As my successor,
Ms. Kanbe was doing her best, but...

00:15:42.484 --> 00:15:47.489
I remember her being
a hardworking and talented employee.

00:15:49.616 --> 00:15:53.953
God is... really unfair, don't you think?

00:15:55.538 --> 00:15:57.040
What do you mean?

00:16:13.848 --> 00:16:17.352
I heard Ms. Kanbe
was diagnosed with cancer...

00:16:17.435 --> 00:16:19.396
and that it's terminal.

00:16:20.522 --> 00:16:22.148
Her husband Hirano...

00:16:22.857 --> 00:16:28.905
He's too busy with some other woman
to even visit.

00:16:30.782 --> 00:16:32.409
Even if I end up bothering her...

00:16:33.159 --> 00:16:36.830
if I can do anything at all
to help her, I will.

00:16:40.375 --> 00:16:41.292
Excuse me.

00:16:41.793 --> 00:16:43.837
Is Kanbe... No.

00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:47.048
Is Ms. Misa Hirano here?
I'd like to see her.

00:16:47.132 --> 00:16:50.260
Ms. Hirano has returned
to her home for the day.

00:16:50.969 --> 00:16:52.220
I see.

00:16:57.642 --> 00:16:59.436
I understand. Thank you.

00:17:45.398 --> 00:17:48.109
What a disgraceful way to die!

00:17:50.069 --> 00:17:54.991
There's no way I'm letting her ashes
into our family grave.

00:17:55.074 --> 00:17:56.451
She's nothing but bad luck!

00:18:00.079 --> 00:18:03.208
Tomoya Hirano. Reina Esaka.
You are under arrest for murder.

00:18:03.291 --> 00:18:05.502
Huh? Wait. No, sir!

00:18:05.585 --> 00:18:11.049
My son didn't do anything!
That woman jumped off on her own!

00:18:11.132 --> 00:18:12.675
Will you come with us too?

00:18:12.759 --> 00:18:14.552
It's about the revisions
to her life insurance.

00:18:14.636 --> 00:18:16.429
Let go of me, you bastards!

00:18:16.513 --> 00:18:20.183
My daughter really likes
the scenery of Toyama.

00:18:21.726 --> 00:18:24.646
Hey, Tomo! Tomo!

00:18:24.729 --> 00:18:28.525
Let go of him! Hey...
He didn't do anything!

00:18:28.608 --> 00:18:32.487
That woman jumped off on her own!

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:33.530
Tomo!

00:18:33.613 --> 00:18:35.573
Tomo! No!

00:18:35.657 --> 00:18:38.535
Tomo. Hey! Let him go!

00:18:38.618 --> 00:18:39.911
Tomo!

00:18:39.994 --> 00:18:43.665
Let him go! Tomo!

00:18:43.748 --> 00:18:45.416
We don't know anything!

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.420
I told you that woman jumped on her own!

00:19:19.993 --> 00:19:24.831
I'm never... going to let you die again.

00:20:13.671 --> 00:20:15.632
I'm sorry. Please come in.

00:20:16.341 --> 00:20:17.842
No, I'm fine...

00:20:20.511 --> 00:20:21.930
Please come in.

00:20:25.475 --> 00:20:26.476
Excuse me.

00:20:32.023 --> 00:20:33.524
Please change into this.

00:20:35.234 --> 00:20:36.611
No, I'm fine.

00:20:36.694 --> 00:20:39.906
I don't want you to catch a cold.
At least just the top.

00:20:43.701 --> 00:20:44.577
Thank you.

00:20:56.547 --> 00:20:57.757
Are you okay?

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:00.176
Yes.

00:21:04.055 --> 00:21:05.348
What happened?

00:21:11.354 --> 00:21:14.774
I got sick of it all.

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:17.777
I tried to change my fate.

00:21:18.736 --> 00:21:20.196
I told him we're breaking up.

00:21:21.364 --> 00:21:22.949
I said I didn't want to get married.

00:21:24.993 --> 00:21:28.496
But... it doesn't seem to work that way.

00:21:31.332 --> 00:21:32.417
Without a substitute.

00:21:33.418 --> 00:21:34.544
A substitute?

00:21:37.797 --> 00:21:40.049
I was the one
who was supposed to get burned.

00:21:40.133 --> 00:21:41.759
But then you stepped in...

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:46.597
Why were you at that apartment?

00:21:48.599 --> 00:21:50.852
I was taking a cab
through the neighborhood...

00:21:51.686 --> 00:21:53.896
and saw you heading to the apartment.

00:21:54.647 --> 00:21:58.609
Why are you helping me?

00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:02.280
Why are you trying
to get involved with me?

00:22:03.531 --> 00:22:05.408
I don't understand why.

00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:26.846
Actually...

00:22:32.018 --> 00:22:33.269
What's wrong?

00:22:35.146 --> 00:22:36.022
I'm sorry.

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:40.234
It's just... It looks terrible on you.

00:22:48.076 --> 00:22:48.910
Actually...

00:22:51.662 --> 00:22:54.540
we've met before. In college.

00:22:55.291 --> 00:22:56.125
What?

00:22:56.209 --> 00:22:59.712
At the pond, near the bench
where I was always reading,

00:23:01.297 --> 00:23:04.050
you were always talking to a turtle.

00:23:05.885 --> 00:23:08.054
What? That Daidai Pond?

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:10.014
Yes.

00:23:10.098 --> 00:23:11.974
We went to the same university?

00:23:12.058 --> 00:23:12.934
Yes.

00:23:14.685 --> 00:23:19.357
You saw me... talking to the turtle?

00:23:20.733 --> 00:23:24.612
Always... just you and that same turtle.

00:23:27.156 --> 00:23:29.158
I didn't have any other friends...

00:23:30.368 --> 00:23:31.786
So you just spied on me?

00:23:31.869 --> 00:23:34.080
You're the one
who came into my line of sight.

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:40.628
Can't miss the strange, lonely girl
that talks to a turtle, right?

00:23:42.755 --> 00:23:43.589
Right.

00:23:51.722 --> 00:23:54.851
When you joined the company as a new hire,

00:23:57.228 --> 00:24:01.315
I kept hoping that I'd get a chance
to speak with you.

00:24:02.567 --> 00:24:04.902
You should have just talked to me.

00:24:05.945 --> 00:24:07.363
You're right.

00:24:08.281 --> 00:24:09.490
That's why...

00:24:10.908 --> 00:24:12.535
I'm talking to you now.

00:24:18.708 --> 00:24:19.667
That day,

00:24:20.418 --> 00:24:22.962
you jumped into the elevator.

00:24:23.045 --> 00:24:23.880
Sorry, sorry!

00:24:31.971 --> 00:24:33.222
It...

00:24:35.975 --> 00:24:40.438
It made me want to... change my life.

00:24:57.663 --> 00:25:00.166
Ms. Kanbe, it's Miku.

00:25:08.799 --> 00:25:09.884
Hello?

00:25:09.967 --> 00:25:11.135
Tomoya?

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:16.933
Reina. What is it? What happened?

00:25:18.017 --> 00:25:21.604
Misa hasn't been well lately,
so I'm getting worried about her.

00:25:22.188 --> 00:25:24.523
Like maybe something happened or...

00:25:24.982 --> 00:25:26.067
Reina...

00:25:27.485 --> 00:25:29.695
I think I might be screwed.

00:25:31.697 --> 00:25:32.740
Misa said...

00:25:33.574 --> 00:25:35.952
she wants to break up!

00:25:44.043 --> 00:25:45.544
This sucks!

00:25:46.879 --> 00:25:47.922
Tomoya?

00:25:49.006 --> 00:25:50.049
Calm down.

00:25:50.132 --> 00:25:51.425
Tell me what happened.

00:25:52.343 --> 00:25:53.761
Don't worry.

00:25:54.303 --> 00:25:56.639
I'll talk it over with you.

00:26:36.637 --> 00:26:41.517
I'm never... going to let you die again.

00:26:43.561 --> 00:26:46.564
Never... again...

00:26:48.816 --> 00:26:49.817
"Again"?

00:26:50.985 --> 00:26:52.695
What did he mean by "again"?

00:26:57.450 --> 00:26:58.826
Maybe I misheard it...

00:27:09.253 --> 00:27:12.006
What are you going to do
with the apartment?

00:27:13.799 --> 00:27:16.218
I think you should
definitely cancel the contract.

00:27:16.302 --> 00:27:19.096
Even if it was an accident,
almost falling from the eighth floor?

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:20.473
That's seriously bad luck.

00:27:21.182 --> 00:27:23.184
That's true, but...

00:27:23.267 --> 00:27:25.603
When I tried to force
my way out of the wedding,

00:27:25.686 --> 00:27:28.481
the same ending that my first life had
came to me again.

00:27:28.564 --> 00:27:30.691
Without a substitute,
fate can't be changed.

00:27:31.692 --> 00:27:33.152
If that's true, then I have to...

00:27:35.321 --> 00:27:36.614
Misa...

00:27:36.697 --> 00:27:41.160
I'm sorry I made things confusing for you
with my horrible apology yesterday.

00:27:41.911 --> 00:27:45.790
So, about not getting married,
or breaking up, or whatever...

00:27:45.873 --> 00:27:48.626
We've spent so much time
building this relationship,

00:27:48.709 --> 00:27:50.920
throwing it away
over something like this is just...

00:27:51.003 --> 00:27:52.922
I don't know what happened,

00:27:53.005 --> 00:27:55.466
but an ambush on the way to work
is just plain creepy.

00:27:55.549 --> 00:27:56.926
This has nothing to do with you.

00:27:57.009 --> 00:28:00.304
Oh, sorry, Miku. Could you go on ahead?

00:28:00.388 --> 00:28:01.722
Sure...

00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:03.933
Are you okay?

00:28:04.016 --> 00:28:05.434
I'll be fine, thanks.

00:28:16.529 --> 00:28:19.782
I was got too emotional yesterday. Sorry.

00:28:22.159 --> 00:28:25.538
I'm not hung up on it at all.
Really, it doesn't bother me at all.

00:28:25.621 --> 00:28:28.082
Let's just say we both messed up
and call it even.

00:28:29.875 --> 00:28:33.712
Anyway, crypto's up again,
so I invested more.

00:28:33.796 --> 00:28:37.925
At this rate, I might be able
to buy that new condo in cash.

00:28:39.176 --> 00:28:40.010
You eat breakfast yet?

00:28:40.094 --> 00:28:43.139
If it's a guy I dumped,
Reina won't want him.

00:28:43.222 --> 00:28:44.223
I'll treat you.

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:47.893
Misa, are you listening?

00:28:52.398 --> 00:28:54.442
Why doesn't she just dump him already?

00:28:54.984 --> 00:28:56.735
I guess the more a girl has it together,

00:28:56.819 --> 00:28:59.196
the more likely they are
to fall for a sleazebag.

00:28:59.697 --> 00:29:01.031
Are you talking about Ms. Kanbe?

00:29:01.115 --> 00:29:03.075
Honestly, I'm worried.

00:29:03.742 --> 00:29:05.411
Let's do another girls' night out soon.

00:29:05.911 --> 00:29:06.745
Yep.

00:29:09.290 --> 00:29:10.249
Reina,

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.209
wanna go to lunch with me?

00:29:15.379 --> 00:29:18.841
I've got some things
to discuss about Tomoya.

00:29:20.801 --> 00:29:23.721
Of course. Tell me everything.

00:29:25.181 --> 00:29:26.265
Let's eat!

00:29:26.849 --> 00:29:29.768
Anyway, let's dig in!
If you don't eat, you won't have energy.

00:29:31.687 --> 00:29:33.898
We decided on the day to meet his parents.

00:29:35.399 --> 00:29:36.233
Huh?

00:29:37.485 --> 00:29:39.987
I'm meeting Tomoya's parents
for the first time,

00:29:40.696 --> 00:29:42.615
so I don't know
what kind of clothes to wear.

00:29:42.698 --> 00:29:44.533
I'm really stressed out over it...

00:29:45.868 --> 00:29:48.204
Is that what you wanted to talk about?

00:29:48.287 --> 00:29:51.749
Yeah. Reina, you have good taste,
so I wanted your advice.

00:29:52.333 --> 00:29:54.793
Will you go shopping with me?

00:29:55.794 --> 00:29:58.380
I thought things weren't
going well with Tomoya?

00:29:59.006 --> 00:30:01.550
Huh? No, no, it's not like that at all!

00:30:01.634 --> 00:30:06.514
Actually, just yesterday, he surprised me
by reserving a brand-new condo.

00:30:06.597 --> 00:30:09.433
But he should've talked to me first,
so we argued a bit.

00:30:09.517 --> 00:30:10.726
But we made up this morning.

00:30:13.687 --> 00:30:18.150
Reina, I heard
you told Tomoya about my mother.

00:30:20.402 --> 00:30:22.780
It was hard for me to tell him.

00:30:23.656 --> 00:30:26.700
I thought Tomoya
might not like me anymore,

00:30:27.743 --> 00:30:30.037
but he said he didn't mind at all,

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:33.123
and he was all worried
about how hard it was for me.

00:30:33.749 --> 00:30:35.501
So it actually brought us closer together.

00:30:35.584 --> 00:30:37.461
Thank you so much.

00:30:39.088 --> 00:30:40.089
Let's eat!

00:30:53.477 --> 00:30:54.728
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:30:55.312 --> 00:30:58.607
thank you very much for attending

00:30:58.691 --> 00:31:01.694
the Suzutoya Holdings
Hospitality Tasting Event today.

00:31:02.278 --> 00:31:04.071
In 2020, five years from now,

00:31:05.114 --> 00:31:07.825
the Olympic Games will be held in Tokyo.

00:31:08.367 --> 00:31:10.244
The Tokyo Olympics will be

00:31:10.327 --> 00:31:13.622
a major event to promote
our country as a tourist destination.

00:31:16.667 --> 00:31:21.797
The number of foreign visitors to Japan
is targeted at 40 million per year.

00:31:22.464 --> 00:31:23.924
We need to reconsider.

00:31:24.466 --> 00:31:28.887
Investing so much into
an Olympic-related business is risky.

00:31:29.597 --> 00:31:32.725
I'd like to propose measures
to reduce losses in restaurant operations.

00:31:32.808 --> 00:31:36.145
That's exactly why
you're not fit to be a leader.

00:31:36.228 --> 00:31:37.229
Enough. Stop talking!

00:31:38.522 --> 00:31:43.819
At Suzutoya, we believe it is our mission
to share Japan's rich culinary culture

00:31:43.902 --> 00:31:47.406
with guests from around the world,

00:31:47.489 --> 00:31:50.659
and to offer heartfelt hospitality
in everything we do.

00:31:50.743 --> 00:31:54.079
Please relax and enjoy the event today.

00:32:15.142 --> 00:32:16.477
HOSPITALITY TASTING EVENT

00:32:56.809 --> 00:32:58.102
These are mushi manju.

00:32:58.185 --> 00:33:00.062
-Brown, white? Here you are.
-Thank you.

00:33:00.145 --> 00:33:02.523
Hey, what's going on,
Second Planning Division?

00:33:02.606 --> 00:33:03.899
Is there a problem?

00:33:03.982 --> 00:33:05.693
There's a problem, all right.

00:33:05.776 --> 00:33:08.195
The chairman of Asahi Department Store
was hospitalized

00:33:08.278 --> 00:33:12.324
for his peanut allergy after eating
a mushi manju served at the tasting event!

00:33:12.408 --> 00:33:13.242
What?

00:33:14.243 --> 00:33:18.247
His wife said that a female employee
gave her this list of ingredients.

00:33:20.124 --> 00:33:22.084
Someone gave her
the wrong ingredient list.

00:33:22.584 --> 00:33:25.212
Of all people, the chairman
of Asahi Department Store?

00:33:25.963 --> 00:33:29.299
Who was it? Who was in charge
of the live kitchen at the tasting event?

00:33:37.057 --> 00:33:38.684
Here you are.

00:33:39.226 --> 00:33:41.437
-Would anybody like one? Thank you.
-Yes, thank you.

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:42.646
That's right, at this time...

00:33:44.231 --> 00:33:45.399
Excuse me.

00:33:45.482 --> 00:33:49.236
Please only serve mushi manju with
red bean paste and white bean paste today.

00:33:49.319 --> 00:33:51.572
Please do not serve ones
with peanut paste.

00:33:51.655 --> 00:33:53.407
Yes, we've been informed.

00:33:54.158 --> 00:33:56.368
Huh? By whom?

00:34:00.873 --> 00:34:01.790
Director.

00:34:04.793 --> 00:34:05.961
What are you doing?

00:34:07.629 --> 00:34:11.717
One of our guests who loves this shop's
mushi manju will be visiting tomorrow.

00:34:12.426 --> 00:34:13.635
Are you keeping some on hold?

00:34:14.178 --> 00:34:15.012
Yes.

00:34:15.721 --> 00:34:16.764
This many?

00:34:17.473 --> 00:34:18.307
Yes.

00:34:18.390 --> 00:34:19.892
Just the peanut ones?

00:34:21.143 --> 00:34:21.977
Ms. Kanbe.

00:34:22.644 --> 00:34:25.063
-Yes.
-We have a lot of guests.

00:34:25.147 --> 00:34:27.191
Should you really
be wasting your time here?

00:34:55.969 --> 00:34:58.180
Come to think of it, Misa...

00:34:58.263 --> 00:35:01.350
said that Director Suzuki
made a pass at her too.

00:35:14.154 --> 00:35:17.115
Director Suzuki,
may I have a word with you?

00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:19.159
What is it?

00:35:19.243 --> 00:35:20.953
As director, I think you should

00:35:21.036 --> 00:35:23.664
refrain from any behavior
that could be misunderstood.

00:35:24.373 --> 00:35:25.916
And what kind of behavior is that?

00:35:26.959 --> 00:35:27.918
Well...

00:35:28.877 --> 00:35:29.920
For example,

00:35:31.255 --> 00:35:33.006
hitting on your subordinate's fiancée.

00:35:36.844 --> 00:35:39.471
Oh... Does that ring a bell?

00:35:39.555 --> 00:35:41.265
Is this something to talk about at work?

00:35:41.348 --> 00:35:44.059
You know that Ms. Kanbe and I
are engaged, right?

00:35:44.685 --> 00:35:47.646
You even celebrated with us
at the vineyard the other day.

00:35:47.729 --> 00:35:49.690
I didn't celebrate anything.

00:35:50.566 --> 00:35:51.400
Huh?

00:35:52.359 --> 00:35:54.444
You two don't suit each other at all.

00:35:55.404 --> 00:35:57.155
Can't you see that yourself?

00:35:58.407 --> 00:36:00.158
You're not a good match for her.

00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:23.015
So exhausting with all the VIP guests.

00:36:32.149 --> 00:36:33.692
Why are these back here?

00:36:35.444 --> 00:36:37.404
What a waste.

00:36:47.289 --> 00:36:49.791
Oh, the chairman of Asahi.
Are you on your way out?

00:36:50.834 --> 00:36:51.710
Who are you?

00:36:51.793 --> 00:36:55.047
I'm Tomita of Suzutoya Holdings'
second planning division.

00:36:55.631 --> 00:36:58.175
I'm already done greeting people,
so I'll be leaving.

00:36:58.258 --> 00:37:00.594
Then, I'll see you out.
I'll go get my boss.

00:37:00.677 --> 00:37:03.680
No, no. I don't want to make a fuss.

00:37:04.222 --> 00:37:06.725
In that case,
may I at least offer you a gift?

00:37:06.808 --> 00:37:10.687
These are mushi manju
from a very famous confectioner.

00:37:13.565 --> 00:37:15.776
Could you give us the list of ingredients?

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:18.236
-A list of ingredients?
-Yes.

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:19.571
Please wait a moment.

00:37:20.447 --> 00:37:21.448
Ms. Esaka.

00:37:21.531 --> 00:37:24.409
Can you bring me the list of ingredients
for the mushi manju?

00:37:24.493 --> 00:37:25.535
Hurry up.

00:37:25.619 --> 00:37:27.871
-We'll bring it right away.
-Yes. Thank you.

00:37:29.039 --> 00:37:29.957
Well, today...

00:37:31.917 --> 00:37:33.919
Always when I'm
in the middle of something.

00:37:34.002 --> 00:37:38.465
WHITE BEAN PASTE - PEANUT PASTE

00:37:38.548 --> 00:37:40.175
You can never be too careful nowadays...

00:37:40.258 --> 00:37:41.093
Yeah.

00:37:41.176 --> 00:37:42.844
Thank you for your patience.

00:37:42.928 --> 00:37:44.805
Here is the ingredient list
for the mushi manju.

00:37:44.888 --> 00:37:46.723
Thank you. Okay, let's go.

00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:55.148
Nitpicky old hag.

00:38:06.576 --> 00:38:09.496
Ms. Kanbe, can you attend
to that group over there?

00:38:09.579 --> 00:38:11.039
-Yes, got it.
-Thanks.

00:38:12.666 --> 00:38:14.251
-Are you enjoying the event?
-Yes.

00:38:14.334 --> 00:38:16.169
-Very good time. Thank you.
-That's good.

00:38:17.713 --> 00:38:19.381
Did you have anything you liked?

00:38:54.499 --> 00:38:55.625
Misa!

00:38:56.793 --> 00:39:01.339
Still working, huh? That's so you,
just like the class representative.

00:39:02.049 --> 00:39:04.342
I have to prepare
for the noon session tomorrow.

00:39:06.595 --> 00:39:08.472
Everyone's already at the reception.

00:39:10.015 --> 00:39:12.100
But honestly, that sounds like a hassle.

00:39:12.184 --> 00:39:13.769
Wanna grab a drink, just the two of us?

00:39:13.852 --> 00:39:17.022
I got a few tips
on some good local izakaya.

00:39:18.607 --> 00:39:21.359
But I'll be a while,
so you can go with someone else.

00:39:21.443 --> 00:39:22.402
What?

00:39:24.696 --> 00:39:28.492
Okay, I'll just wait right here
until your work is done.

00:39:33.997 --> 00:39:34.915
Oh...

00:39:36.541 --> 00:39:37.584
Am I intruding?

00:39:37.667 --> 00:39:39.503
Oh, well, you're not intruding but...

00:39:41.963 --> 00:39:44.091
You asked me earlier!

00:39:44.174 --> 00:39:46.134
About what to wear
to meet Tomoya's parents.

00:39:46.218 --> 00:39:49.096
-You wanted to talk about it.
-We can do that another time.

00:39:55.268 --> 00:39:57.312
"Let's go shopping together"?

00:39:57.938 --> 00:39:59.648
"Let's pick out clothes together"?

00:40:00.690 --> 00:40:04.736
Misa... do you really want my opinion?

00:40:06.113 --> 00:40:07.197
What do you mean?

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:08.698
You don't mean it, do you?

00:40:09.366 --> 00:40:12.702
Like when you said,
"Thank you so much for telling Tomoya

00:40:12.786 --> 00:40:16.081
about my mom abandoning me for a man."

00:40:20.168 --> 00:40:23.004
Hey, Misa, what are you so angry about?

00:40:23.713 --> 00:40:24.548
Angry?

00:40:25.048 --> 00:40:26.925
Tell me how you really feel.

00:40:27.676 --> 00:40:30.929
I don't know how you feel at all
these days.

00:40:31.888 --> 00:40:33.515
You're really angry, aren't you?

00:40:34.099 --> 00:40:36.518
-What are you talking about?
-That's enough!

00:40:36.601 --> 00:40:38.687
There's something
that's bothering you, right?

00:40:39.396 --> 00:40:40.772
Is it about the class reunion?

00:40:41.606 --> 00:40:45.068
Maybe you still haven't forgiven me
for what happened with Yuto?

00:40:45.152 --> 00:40:47.362
-That was a long time ago.
-Then what?

00:40:48.446 --> 00:40:50.991
What did I do to you?

00:40:53.743 --> 00:40:55.704
Just tell me already!

00:40:56.746 --> 00:40:57.706
It's just...

00:41:01.877 --> 00:41:05.505
I'm just getting
a little tired of being friends.

00:41:08.008 --> 00:41:11.970
I always thought that
I would be lost without you.

00:41:12.512 --> 00:41:16.057
That without you, I would be alone...

00:41:18.101 --> 00:41:20.854
But that wasn't true.

00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:24.858
I have Tomoya.

00:41:28.028 --> 00:41:29.529
Oh, sorry.

00:41:29.613 --> 00:41:32.073
I'm actually meeting up
with Tomoya tonight.

00:41:32.782 --> 00:41:36.161
The view from my room is amazing at night,

00:41:36.244 --> 00:41:39.664
and we're planning to have
some drinks there after work.

00:41:43.335 --> 00:41:44.794
Reina,

00:41:45.795 --> 00:41:48.131
don't worry yourself so much over me.

00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:50.884
Find someone nice.

00:41:56.514 --> 00:41:58.225
Oh, I'll help with that!

00:42:47.983 --> 00:42:49.234
Reina.

00:42:51.945 --> 00:42:53.196
What's up?

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:54.531
What do you want?

00:42:55.532 --> 00:42:56.783
Have you seen Misa?

00:42:57.450 --> 00:42:59.869
I'm looking for her,
but I can't find her anywhere.

00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:01.871
She's working.

00:43:02.706 --> 00:43:04.291
She's still working?

00:43:11.131 --> 00:43:14.509
I just... want to cry.

00:43:25.937 --> 00:43:26.980
There, there.

00:43:29.357 --> 00:43:33.611
I'm... always trying so hard.

00:43:35.822 --> 00:43:37.073
You are.

00:43:37.991 --> 00:43:39.075
Good for you.

00:43:40.994 --> 00:43:43.496
I always feel so alone!

00:43:44.205 --> 00:43:45.457
You poor thing.

00:43:46.708 --> 00:43:48.084
It's okay.

00:43:53.757 --> 00:43:54.674
You're so nice.

00:44:01.306 --> 00:44:02.640
What do you think this is?

00:44:04.476 --> 00:44:06.728
The key to Misa's room.

00:44:08.938 --> 00:44:12.776
She said the view
is just gorgeous at night,

00:44:13.526 --> 00:44:17.947
but hard-working Misa
is working until late.

00:44:20.867 --> 00:44:25.538
Can you imagine
how exciting this situation could get?

00:44:29.084 --> 00:44:30.460
Just tonight.

00:44:31.211 --> 00:44:33.046
Just once before you get married...

00:44:34.714 --> 00:44:35.799
let's do something bad.

00:45:08.164 --> 00:45:09.833
-To Grand Stay Hotel.
-Got it.

00:46:14.522 --> 00:46:15.565
You'll get cold.

00:46:49.516 --> 00:46:52.310
That's not how
you're supposed to drink whiskey.

00:46:55.355 --> 00:46:57.565
You're not going to
ask me anything, are you?

00:47:01.277 --> 00:47:08.243
When I saw them in the cab earlier,
I thought of something strange.

00:47:09.118 --> 00:47:10.119
Something strange?

00:47:12.205 --> 00:47:14.582
How I fell in love with that man.

00:47:18.836 --> 00:47:20.338
Do you want to exchange contacts?

00:47:26.511 --> 00:47:31.516
I thought, "Oh, here we go again."

00:47:33.685 --> 00:47:39.899
Everyone who talks to me
ends up liking Reina.

00:47:42.318 --> 00:47:43.736
Actually... I think I won't.

00:47:44.487 --> 00:47:45.321
What?

00:47:45.405 --> 00:47:47.282
I don't want Ms. Kanbe to misunderstand.

00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:56.624
Just from that one small thing...

00:47:58.710 --> 00:48:03.089
I found myself thinking,
"I can trust this person."

00:48:05.133 --> 00:48:07.385
It was such a tiny gesture,

00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:14.017
but back then, it meant the world to me.

00:48:16.644 --> 00:48:21.608
For some reason, I suddenly remembered
that moment from so long ago.

00:48:22.984 --> 00:48:24.485
Silly, right?

00:48:28.489 --> 00:48:30.074
Do you regret it?

00:48:32.577 --> 00:48:33.911
Not at all!

00:48:42.128 --> 00:48:44.339
Let's think about the future.

00:48:45.381 --> 00:48:47.592
There's so much to look forward to.

00:48:49.218 --> 00:48:51.012
I hope so.

00:48:51.095 --> 00:48:52.430
You don't believe so?

00:48:53.139 --> 00:48:54.807
Life is harsh.

00:48:56.267 --> 00:48:58.895
And you don't have the will
to dream of something better?

00:49:00.271 --> 00:49:02.690
Honestly... I don't.

00:49:06.402 --> 00:49:07.445
What about you?

00:49:08.571 --> 00:49:09.405
Huh?

00:49:10.239 --> 00:49:12.116
Do you have anything?

00:49:13.326 --> 00:49:14.619
Like a dream or...

00:49:22.168 --> 00:49:23.795
My dream...

00:49:25.129 --> 00:49:26.339
Shall I talk about it?

00:49:28.257 --> 00:49:30.259
My dreams for the future...

00:49:30.343 --> 00:49:31.177
Yeah.

00:49:32.804 --> 00:49:36.516
We get to know each other a little better.

00:49:37.392 --> 00:49:42.105
So far, the only thing we have in common
is a love of monaka and hojicha.

00:49:43.064 --> 00:49:44.315
We need real conversations.

00:49:45.692 --> 00:49:46.567
Yeah.

00:49:47.902 --> 00:49:49.404
Because...

00:49:50.697 --> 00:49:54.409
we don't know each other's
favorite books, music, or movies.

00:49:57.161 --> 00:49:58.246
That's why...

00:50:00.415 --> 00:50:02.875
we need to spend
a little more time together first.

00:50:04.377 --> 00:50:07.130
Strolling through the park, having tea...

00:50:09.006 --> 00:50:11.467
watching movies
and exchanging thoughts afterward.

00:50:16.723 --> 00:50:22.395
Let's go watch Your Name and La La Land.

00:50:29.986 --> 00:50:32.655
We'll stroll around after the movie,

00:50:34.282 --> 00:50:38.369
join the line with the high school girls
in Harajuku,

00:50:40.121 --> 00:50:44.292
and have some tapioca milk tea.

00:50:45.585 --> 00:50:48.463
If you want to take pictures
at Instagrammable spots...

00:50:50.631 --> 00:50:53.843
well, I'll just have to tag along.

00:50:56.387 --> 00:50:59.766
When the state of emergency gets declared,
we can't go see each other,

00:51:00.975 --> 00:51:02.560
but we'll talk online.

00:51:04.854 --> 00:51:08.274
And during the no-spectator 2021 Olympics,

00:51:10.276 --> 00:51:12.737
let's cheer on the skateboarders
winning gold...

00:51:14.947 --> 00:51:16.741
from the sofa at home.

00:51:20.495 --> 00:51:22.330
Once the pandemic calms down,

00:51:23.623 --> 00:51:25.416
and our daily lives come back...

00:51:32.590 --> 00:51:34.133
Let's go wherever...

00:51:36.135 --> 00:51:37.470
together.

00:51:38.554 --> 00:51:40.723
Even to Toyama, where you were born.

00:51:42.850 --> 00:51:43.893
Or...

00:51:45.686 --> 00:51:49.398
we can go to Los Angeles
to watch Shohei Ohtani.

00:51:53.444 --> 00:51:54.362
This is...

00:51:59.408 --> 00:52:02.161
the future I wanted to spend with you.
