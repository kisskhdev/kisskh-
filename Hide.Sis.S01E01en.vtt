00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.585
(Every family has secrets.)

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.356
(The secret that only the family members know.)

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.585
I knew you would be the first one to come here.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.000
(There’s a reason it is kept a secret.)

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.621
(The moment the secret is exposed.)

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.403
(Family might no longer be a family.)

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.276
(To protect the important thing, )

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.680
(How far are you willing to go
to keep the secret?)

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.669
(Will you lie?)

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.698
(Will you cover it up?)

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.898
(Or will you even kill?)

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:57.527
Picha.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.727
Are you ready to answer my questions?

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:02.829
What happened?

00:01:04.036 --> 00:01:05.036
I…

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.843
My sister’s name is Chatfah.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.520
Chat.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:19.890
Chat.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.189
When I got there,

00:01:22.807 --> 00:01:24.810
Chatfah was lying on the ground.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.010
Chat.

00:01:29.047 --> 00:01:30.047
Bua.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:38.570
Chat.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:41.540
Chom.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.803
Chom, call the police.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.520
Blood.

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.854
There was blood everywhere.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.047
I don’t know what happened.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.425
Was Chatfah dead?

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.310
Chom.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:00.480
Chom.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.167
Go help her.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.840
Chom, help me stop the bleeding.

00:02:15.592 --> 00:02:17.840
(911, what’s your emergency?)

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:42.610
My sister.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.378
My sister was stabbed.

00:02:49.272 --> 00:02:51.270
I’ll get a towel to stop the bleeding.

00:02:51.294 --> 00:02:52.458
Take care of her.

00:03:23.461 --> 00:03:26.392
(Pi, I’m waiting for you.)

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:40.770
(Do you have any idea
who attacked your sister?)

00:03:41.607 --> 00:03:44.058
I heard you guys were very close.

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:46.785
We…

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.356
We were close?

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:16.218
12 HOURS EARLIER

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.083
(Pi, I’m waiting for you.)

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:24.749
Miss Pi.

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.283
Here is your purse.

00:05:26.312 --> 00:05:28.421
Are you going to Bupphachat Mansion?

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:29.450
Yes.

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.927
My family has an important gathering.

00:05:31.963 --> 00:05:34.036
Actually, I don’t want to leave the shooting.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.014
It’s a new collection for this year.

00:05:36.036 --> 00:05:37.170
Please take a look.

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:39.570
Do you like it?

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.145
I want the logo to be more prominent.

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:45.403
Can you adjust the color tone…

00:05:45.425 --> 00:05:46.763
Miss Pi.

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.058
God Gem just launched their new collection.

00:05:52.785 --> 00:05:54.705
It looks exactly like ours.

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.836
They launched it before us.

00:05:56.872 --> 00:05:59.600
They will accuse us of copying them again.

00:06:02.123 --> 00:06:04.210
BUPPHACHINDA IS A MURDERER.
Tell them to come out and talk to us.

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:06.586
Come out now.
STOP USING PESTICIDE!
YOU’RE KILLING THE COMMUNITY

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.821
No one responds to our contacts.

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:10.727
Come out.

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:16.110
Mr. Kajorn.

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:18.450
Mr. Kajorn, don’t ignore us.

00:06:18.487 --> 00:06:20.768
The villagers are sick because of the chemicals used on your farm.

00:06:20.792 --> 00:06:24.494
My oldest child is sick at home because
the water is contaminated with pesticides.

00:06:24.516 --> 00:06:26.014
Please help us.

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.556
Our legal team is informed about it.

00:06:29.585 --> 00:06:31.345
But we never received any contact from them.

00:06:31.781 --> 00:06:33.780
They will contact you soon.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.356
We will sue you.

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:43.040
Especially those who accuse our company without evidence.

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:52.356
Villagers are gathering at the entrance.

00:06:52.392 --> 00:06:55.032
Do you want to use the back entrance instead?

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:58.050
No.

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:00.670
This is a good chance for us.

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:06.298
Mr. Kajorn.

00:07:06.341 --> 00:07:07.341
Mr. Kajorn.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:08.460
Mr. Kajorn.

00:07:08.916 --> 00:07:10.152
Please help us.

00:07:10.167 --> 00:07:11.243
Don’t sue us.

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.112
Mr. Kajorn.

00:07:13.141 --> 00:07:14.130
Mr. Kajorn.

00:07:14.152 --> 00:07:15.152
Mr. Kajorn.

00:07:15.229 --> 00:07:17.440
Mr. Kajorn, please don’t sue us.

00:07:17.476 --> 00:07:18.476
Mr. Kajorn.

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:24.232
Are you alright?

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:25.643
Your shoe.

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:28.010
It’s okay.

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:32.327
Take her child to the hospital.

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:34.160
I’ll cover the medical bills.

00:07:34.327 --> 00:07:35.327
Yes.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.923
Everyone, don’t worry.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:43.796
Bupphachinda will do its best
to compensate those who are affected.

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.032
Here are your shoes, Miss Bua.

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:24.305
The compensation budget
that you approve to create a false image.

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:28.036
No, to create an alliance.

00:08:28.065 --> 00:08:29.140
That’s a lot of money.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:35.207
I have been dealing with crises
even before you were born.

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:38.800
You should let me
and the executive board handle it.

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.250
Miss Bua, please let us handle it.

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:45.432
Okay. This is it for today.

00:08:45.461 --> 00:08:46.618
Thank you, everyone.

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:50.349
Bua and I have family matters to discuss.

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:52.276
Please excuse us.

00:09:04.574 --> 00:09:06.981
Bua, you can go by yourself, right?

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:08.250
Or do you want to ride with me?

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.407
I can go by myself.

00:09:11.061 --> 00:09:13.156
Bupphachat Mansion is my house.

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:17.970
Who knows?

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:20.087
When the will is revealed,

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:22.763
the mansion might no longer be yours.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:26.940
I’m kidding.

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:29.250
It’s just a joke. Don’t take it seriously.

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:39.105
He’s so cocky.

00:09:39.141 --> 00:09:41.898
He gets too big for his boots.

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:50.123
I hope the shares I will get from my dad’s will are larger than Uncle Kajorn’s total shares.

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:56.356
Miss Bua, the art department said
the photo is ready.

00:09:58.720 --> 00:09:59.720
Here.

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.520
The executive board is siding with my uncle.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:13.869
But the public is on my side.

00:10:15.105 --> 00:10:16.105
Post it.

00:10:16.312 --> 00:10:17.312
Yes.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.094
IS SHE THE OLDEST DAUGHTER?
SHE’S THE MOST TALENTED.

00:10:24.116 --> 00:10:25.190
SHE’S MUCH BETTER THAN
THE MALE EXECUTIVE.

00:10:25.214 --> 00:10:26.397
REMEMBER THE 2ND SISTER, CHOMPOO?
SHE’S SUCH A BRAT.
WE SHOULD WAIT AND SEE.
DON’T CRITICIZE ME YET,
BUT I THINK THIS FAMILY IS SLY.

00:10:26.421 --> 00:10:30.181
SHE’S THE GEM OF BUPPHACHINDA.
SHE’S SO KIND.
SHE DOESN’T CARE THAT
SHE RUINS HER EXPENSIVE SHOE.

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:41.461
Great.

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:43.505
Okay.

00:10:43.549 --> 00:10:44.549
Good job.

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:47.570
Thank you.

00:10:47.592 --> 00:10:48.800
Goodbye.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.538
The client said your body looks amazing.

00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:57.076
That’s right.

00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:59.360
Her body looks amazing.

00:10:59.396 --> 00:11:02.349
Especially in the video clip.

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.789
But it’s not a photoshoot video.

00:11:05.818 --> 00:11:07.520
But I can’t say what kind of video it is.

00:11:12.072 --> 00:11:14.734
We always need to improve ourselves.

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:16.460
You too.

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:18.410
You need to take better care of yourself.

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:20.378
You always eat junk food.

00:11:20.414 --> 00:11:22.012
Stylists need to resize your outfits several times.

00:11:22.036 --> 00:11:23.178
I feel bad for them.

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:26.436
We should go.

00:11:32.509 --> 00:11:33.687
Let’s go.

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:37.054
Use only the photos
in which she wears a mask.

00:11:37.076 --> 00:11:40.029
I don’t want our client to know
that the model is her.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.600
Hey!

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:42.770
Excuse me.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:44.906
If it’s because of the scandal,

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:46.218
then why did you hire me?

00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:58.414
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:01.610
Nathat.

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:03.270
Chom.

00:12:08.654 --> 00:12:12.552
I’m here to try my wedding tuxedo.

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:15.563
Your wedding is coming soon.

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:18.749
You must be busy.

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:21.750
Yes.

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:23.940
I have a meeting later with my wedding planner.

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:26.145
I have a lot of things to do today.

00:12:26.189 --> 00:12:28.007
So I can’t go to Bupphachat Mansion.

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:31.483
I don’t know if Chat will be mad at me.

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:36.821
Mr. Nathat.

00:12:37.105 --> 00:12:38.356
Please come into the studio.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:43.709
I got to go.

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:15.330
I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:19.069
Thana.

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:20.698
Picha.

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:22.400
I’m sorry.

00:13:22.443 --> 00:13:25.803
The canvases block my rearview mirror.

00:13:25.832 --> 00:13:27.556
I didn’t see that your car was coming.

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:30.979
Fortunately, we can avoid the accident.

00:13:31.003 --> 00:13:32.705
But you need to be careful next time.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Yes.

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:37.636
It’s been a long time since I last saw you.

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:39.934
How are you doing?

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:41.970
I’m doing fine.

00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:44.305
I got to go.

00:13:44.334 --> 00:13:45.883
We have a family gathering today.

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:47.949
So…

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:50.334
Everyone will be there, right?

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:53.141
I mean your sisters.

00:13:55.781 --> 00:13:57.780
Are you asking about Chatfah?

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:01.469
Yes.

00:14:35.592 --> 00:14:37.170
Miss Picha.

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:39.592
Are you alright?

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:44.261
The bird hit my windshield and died.

00:14:44.298 --> 00:14:48.341
This happens a lot
during the bird migration season.

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:53.207
It probably saw the reflection of the sky
on your windshield.

00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:54.930
So it flew into it.

00:14:57.650 --> 00:14:59.650
Please go inside.

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:01.570
It’s almost time.

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.429
I’ll have someone clean your car.

00:15:04.465 --> 00:15:05.520
Please come in.

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:26.901
I knew you would be the first one to arrive.

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:30.100
Why?

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:35.272
You are attached to this house the most.

00:15:37.767 --> 00:15:39.770
I hope you will have it.

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:43.585
What about you, Chat?

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.796
Is there anything that you want?

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:48.429
Family.

00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:51.556
I always want to be a part of the family.

00:15:52.698 --> 00:15:54.650
I think you understand me the most.

00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:08.669
My sister…likes attention.

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.687
Her favorite game is…

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:14.370
Hide and Seek.

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:17.723
It’s an ordinary kids’ game.

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:20.807
But my sister…

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:23.192
She plays it differently.

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:27.745
She sent letters to all of us before the game.

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:33.229
Whether we wanted to play or not.

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:36.967
PI, I’M WAITING FOR YOU.

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:48.836
Tada!

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:55.701
I told you not to take your sister into the woods.

00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:57.010
Why didn’t you listen to me?

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.338
If something happens to her, I’ll kill you.

00:16:59.381 --> 00:17:02.770
I didn’t mean it. I’m sorry.

00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:14.058
You are the only one
who went out to look for me.

00:17:14.087 --> 00:17:15.389
I’m sorry.

00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:28.414
The house is so damn far.

00:17:30.567 --> 00:17:31.578
Pi.

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:32.960
You’re here.

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:40.378
Why do we need to
have a meeting at this house?

00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:43.352
No one lives at our family’s house.

00:17:43.374 --> 00:17:45.578
None of us lives here either.

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:47.970
Do you want to go to our family’s house?

00:17:57.250 --> 00:17:58.458
Here is fine.

00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:01.905
Chatfah is here.

00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:04.763
I don’t want to know.

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:11.120
Cousins.

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:12.240
Hello.

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:15.069
I told Aunt Chom to prepare rooms for you.

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:16.900
Who said I would spend the night here?

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:19.340
I did.

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:21.605
You don’t have to work tomorrow, do you?

00:18:21.629 --> 00:18:23.265
Why do you want to drive back at night?

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:26.938
No, I don’t but this house doesn’t have Wi-Fi.

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:28.703
Who would watch my live streaming?

00:18:28.727 --> 00:18:29.727
Ghosts?

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:31.832
Why don’t we sleep in the same room?

00:18:31.854 --> 00:18:33.418
Just like we did when we were young.

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:34.740
Parn.

00:18:34.901 --> 00:18:36.900
Do you have over-attachment issues like Chat?

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:41.978
Everyone loves their siblings.

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:45.980
Do you love your youngest sister?

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:54.458
I haven’t seen you guys for a while.

00:18:54.487 --> 00:18:55.912
You are still the same.

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.741
I went to get my wedding invitations.

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:00.807
I’ve chosen the wedding date.

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:24.814
You are such a good daughter.

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:28.346
You chose to hand out the invitation
on the 100th day of Dad’s and Mom’s deaths.

00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:31.781
I actually wanted to wait.

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:34.989
But Nathat’s family rushed me
about the wedding.

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:44.392
The invitation card is beautiful.

00:19:44.436 --> 00:19:46.770
Did you design it yourself?

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:53.018
I put my best effort into it.

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:56.872
Next week, I’ll take you to a dressmaker shop.

00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:58.220
Yes.

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:02.160
Do you guys have a dress for the ceremony?

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:04.763
I’ve ordered my tailored dress.

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:08.014
Do you want to show it to me first?

00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:10.186
I don’t want you to wear the same dress
as the groom’s family members.

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:11.210
Chat.

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:16.138
I’m going to wear a black dress.

00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:18.196
Will someone else wear it?

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.727
You should save it for your event.

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:25.178
Maybe you will need it soon.

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:29.321
With your sharp tongue, I don’t think
you will live until your wedding day.

00:20:29.345 --> 00:20:30.345
Chom.

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:37.643
Today, we will find out who Dad loved the most.

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:41.352
Dad’s love has nothing to do
with how he divided his assets.

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:44.240
He divided them in the way
that he thought was best for us.

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:48.545
Bua, are you sure that’s what you really think?

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:55.112
If you find out that he didn’t think you were important to him,

00:20:55.847 --> 00:20:57.850
he didn’t view you as family,

00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:01.818
Will you really be okay with it?

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:11.461
We have always said
family is the most important thing.

00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:16.567
Today, we will find out what is really important.

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:24.880
Everyone is ready.

00:21:24.916 --> 00:21:26.560
Please go in.

00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:30.916
Since you are all here.

00:21:30.952 --> 00:21:35.629
I’ll begin reading
the will of Mr. Asoksapun Bupphachinda.

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:38.363
It was written before his death.

00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:46.029
Do you remember the details in the will?

00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:52.058
Disaster.

00:21:52.763 --> 00:21:56.574
I, Mr. Asoksapun Bupphachinda,

00:21:56.610 --> 00:22:00.661
write this will to declare my intentions

00:22:00.712 --> 00:22:06.952
regarding the distribution of my assets
upon my demise.

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:12.269
1. The cash in my bank account
worth 300 million baht,

00:22:12.305 --> 00:22:18.683
and my 50 percent of Bupphachinda Company’s shares, I leave them to…

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:25.636
Miss Chatfah Bupphachinda solely.

00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:42.530
2. The house and real estate in my name,

00:22:42.581 --> 00:22:44.050
I leave them to…

00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:50.327
Miss Chatfah Bupphachinda solely.

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:02.370
3. Bupphachat Mansion, I leave it to…

00:23:09.803 --> 00:23:11.258
Picha, do you see this?

00:23:12.203 --> 00:23:14.200
This is our flower farm.

00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:17.658
This is Bupphachat Mansion.

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:19.898
You were born here.

00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:22.523
The first time I held you in my arms,

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:25.454
you looked so innocent and pure.

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:29.781
That’s why I named you Pudpichaya.

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:32.109
It means pure flowers.

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:34.523
One day,

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:39.032
this house will be yours.

00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:42.334
Bupphachat Mansion, I leave it to…

00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:47.185
Miss Chatfah Bupphachinda solely.

00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:00.967
Dad, are you mad at Uncle Asok?

00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:05.083
It’s what I have expected.

00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:09.440
I didn’t expect to get anything
from a guy like him.

00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:13.963
Do you know why he did that?

00:24:15.876 --> 00:24:17.185
How would I know?

00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:21.563
No one could understand
what was on his mind.

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:26.349
I know that Chatfah was his favorite child.

00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:29.832
But don’t you think
it’s unfair to his other daughters?

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:34.480
Parn.

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:39.229
We all love ourselves the most.

00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:17.100
Hey!

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.381
What the hell are you doing?

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:23.527
The person you should ask that question
is Dad.

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:25.670
Dad, why the f*ck did you do that?

00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:30.952
Chom, you are drunk.

00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:34.560
The person who should feel upset the most
is you.

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:37.061
You are the only one who was born here.

00:25:37.396 --> 00:25:39.200
This mansion should be given to you.

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:41.963
He often said that he would give it to you.

00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:43.620
Chompoo.

00:25:43.781 --> 00:25:44.967
You too.

00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:48.330
You work your butt off for the company
but you get nothing.

00:25:49.330 --> 00:25:52.792
I know that among us, I was his least favorite.

00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:55.163
But you two,

00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:57.192
I don’t get it.

00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:00.429
How could he pull this shit on you!?

00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:13.650
Why did Dad leave everything to you?

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:21.585
You knew that he would do this, didn’t you?

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:27.847
He must have his reason.

00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:30.490
Reason?

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:47.083
The reason is that you are a weasel.

00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:49.178
Am I right?

00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:52.203
You are a weasel.

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:54.005
You manipulated him and betrayed your sisters.

00:26:54.029 --> 00:26:55.738
Because you wanted to get everything.

00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:57.556
Are you happy now?

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:01.629
The mansion, his assets, and the man,
you want them all.

00:27:01.672 --> 00:27:04.312
Have you ever seen us as your sisters?

00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:08.370
I thought you would be the least upset
about getting nothing.

00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:10.378
Unexpectedly,

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:12.174
You are the most upset.

00:27:12.712 --> 00:27:14.710
I’m not saying this for myself.

00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:18.458
I’m blasting you because you took everything
that was supposed to be theirs.

00:27:19.210 --> 00:27:20.290
Why?

00:27:20.334 --> 00:27:21.934
Do you have to always win?

00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:23.410
Do you need to always act superior?

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:23.883
Chompoo.

00:27:23.912 --> 00:27:24.676
What the hell is wrong with you?

00:27:24.705 --> 00:27:25.316
Chompoo.

00:27:25.345 --> 00:27:26.087
Get a grip!

00:27:26.116 --> 00:27:26.858
Chompoo.

00:27:26.909 --> 00:27:29.090
What the f*ck is wrong with you?

00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:31.390
See?

00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:33.832
I told you.

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:37.192
When you realize
that you aren’t that important,

00:27:38.778 --> 00:27:40.780
None of you can accept it.

00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:46.792
Chompoo!

00:27:46.814 --> 00:27:47.280
Come here.

00:27:47.316 --> 00:27:48.538
Chompoo, stop it.

00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:49.025
Stop.

00:27:49.054 --> 00:27:49.505
I’ll hit her.

00:27:49.534 --> 00:27:50.225
Stop it.

00:27:50.261 --> 00:27:50.807
You, b*tch.

00:27:50.843 --> 00:27:51.843
Stop it.

00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:53.367
This is too much. Stop it.

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:55.505
This is enough.

00:27:55.549 --> 00:27:56.865
Bua, you too.

00:27:57.490 --> 00:28:00.487
You act like a big sister who knows everything.

00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:03.207
But actually, you know nothing.

00:28:03.236 --> 00:28:04.236
Chat!

00:28:04.790 --> 00:28:06.116
I told you.

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.200
Today, we would find out…

00:28:09.767 --> 00:28:11.770
who Dad loved the most.

00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:16.007
How is it?

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:22.232
Being betrayed by your own family.

00:28:22.967 --> 00:28:24.970
When being betrayed by the enemy we hate,

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:27.985
It doesn’t hurt as much as
being backstabbed by our own family.

00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:32.305
The truth is…

00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:38.865
Sisters are enemies given by my parents since I was born.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.090
Chompoo.

00:28:45.134 --> 00:28:45.883
Chom.

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:46.920
Let me go.

00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:47.970
Chom.

00:28:47.992 --> 00:28:48.992
Ouch!

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:53.381
Pi, I’m sorry.

00:28:53.410 --> 00:28:54.410
It’s okay.

00:28:54.487 --> 00:28:55.840
Chom, are you hurt?

00:28:55.876 --> 00:28:57.723
It’s not time to worry about me.

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:00.436
Let’s get your wound treated.

00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:09.563
Tonight at 9 pm.

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:11.614
At the viewing room on the third floor,

00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:13.898
where I often go to enjoy the view

00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:17.541
If any of you think it’s unfair,

00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:20.349
and you want me to give anything back,

00:29:20.378 --> 00:29:21.738
I’ll do so.

00:29:23.825 --> 00:29:27.570
If you only tell me who killed Mom.

00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:51.570
After treating the wound,
don’t forget to put a bandage on it.

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:53.280
Thank you.

00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:56.378
What Chat said is like lines from a soap opera.

00:29:56.407 --> 00:29:57.781
Does she want to be an actress?

00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:01.170
Stop drinking.

00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:04.363
Just let me drink.

00:30:04.392 --> 00:30:05.963
Otherwise, I’ll chew her out.

00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:09.083
What are you going to do?

00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:10.730
Will you go meet her?

00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:14.436
You can go if you want.

00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:16.792
But if I have to get down on my knees
and beg her,

00:30:16.821 --> 00:30:18.000
No way.

00:30:18.036 --> 00:30:19.570
I think she just said it.

00:30:19.592 --> 00:30:21.410
If we go, she’ll laugh at us and backtrack.

00:30:22.465 --> 00:30:24.470
What she said is strange.

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:26.676
What does she mean?

00:30:27.229 --> 00:30:29.230
Who killed Mom?

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:32.545
Can we admit the truth?

00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:34.960
The police already told us who did it.

00:30:35.003 --> 00:30:38.000
We need to stop beating around the bush
and avoiding the topic.

00:30:38.029 --> 00:30:39.185
Stop talking.

00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:44.378
But she said one of us did it.

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:46.940
Maybe…

00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:49.374
She knows something we don’t.

00:30:49.418 --> 00:30:51.105
What else could it be?

00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:55.170
We saw what happened that day.

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:13.440
They were alone in the house.

00:31:14.610 --> 00:31:17.730
One of them must have done it.

00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:24.090
Was there someone else in the house?

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:27.483
Besides Dad and Mom.

00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:33.243
I told you.

00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:37.760
Chat probably made it up,
so she doesn’t need to give us anything.

00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:39.790
Pi.

00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:42.560
If you want the house,

00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:44.690
you should go ask her.

00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:47.163
You are closest to her.

00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:48.574
Am I?

00:31:51.130 --> 00:31:53.200
I’m not sure anymore.

00:31:53.229 --> 00:31:54.465
I think you should go.

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:57.236
If it is you, she might listen.

00:31:58.407 --> 00:32:01.854
Assets are merely external things.

00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:05.250
Even Dad and Mom don’t give us anything.

00:32:05.287 --> 00:32:07.389
We can acquire it by ourselves.

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:09.578
But Chat was right.

00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:13.170
We don’t want his assets.

00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:18.545
The truth is we just want to know…

00:32:18.618 --> 00:32:20.385
how much he loved us.

00:32:45.316 --> 00:32:46.792
I’m drunk.

00:32:47.563 --> 00:32:48.603
I’m going back to my room.

00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:52.660
Chom.

00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:57.556
You are not going to see Chat, right?

00:32:58.330 --> 00:33:00.203
I will never go.

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:03.440
If I have to beg her, I’d rather kill myself.

00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:10.730
What is this?

00:33:17.230 --> 00:33:18.538
I brought work to do here.

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:20.734
Go back to your room.

00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:23.900
Fine.

00:33:24.970 --> 00:33:28.174
Pi, I’m sorry.

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:29.400
I was drunk.

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:31.847
It’s okay.

00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:34.494
I think I should go back to my room too.

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:37.240
See you.

00:33:57.687 --> 00:34:00.727
MR. ASOKSAPUN BUPPHACHINDA.
THE PROBABILITY OF PARTENITY IS NONE.

00:34:54.247 --> 00:34:55.258
Uncle Kajorn.

00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:56.510
Sorry.

00:34:56.836 --> 00:34:59.658
I secretly drink your dad’s whiskey.

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:03.600
It’s okay.

00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:12.443
The executive board will call for a meeting soon.

00:35:14.170 --> 00:35:15.570
Uncle.

00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:17.556
About the company’s shares…

00:35:17.585 --> 00:35:20.232
I know what you are trying to do.

00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:24.516
Today, you saw that
your effort isn’t appreciated.

00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:27.578
You own fewer shares than me.

00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:30.661
You have less influence in the executive board.

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:33.316
I think you should give up.

00:35:33.850 --> 00:35:36.247
The company will never be yours.

00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:39.825
If I ask Chat to sell her shares to me,

00:35:40.410 --> 00:35:41.963
things will be different.

00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:43.541
Someone like you,

00:35:45.149 --> 00:35:47.150
Can you really beg your sister for help?

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:48.894
If I don’t have other choices,

00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:51.550
it’s not a bad idea to give it a try.

00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:03.600
It seems like
I don’t know you as well as I thought.

00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:06.996
But I think I know Chatfah well.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.600
Now, she has the shares worth a fortune.

00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:12.750
She won’t give them to anyone easily.

00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:16.400
If you want them,

00:36:17.556 --> 00:36:19.560
you’ll need to beg your sister.

00:37:15.701 --> 00:37:16.701
Nathat.

00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:22.380
Chom.

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:23.963
I heard what happened.

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:26.349
Are you okay?

00:37:28.690 --> 00:37:29.690
I…

00:37:30.410 --> 00:37:31.963
I’m okay.

00:37:31.985 --> 00:37:34.429
I know it’s useless to say it now.

00:37:35.483 --> 00:37:36.632
I’m sorry.

00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:40.538
I’m sorry for everything I did to you.

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:42.858
I…

00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:43.170
CHAT, I’M GOING TO MEET YOU.

00:39:54.570 --> 00:39:55.570
Chat.

00:39:59.370 --> 00:40:00.625
I’m here.

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:44.530
We are police officers.

00:40:50.378 --> 00:40:52.538
We received a report
that someone fell from a building.

00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:00.450
Where is the victim?

00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:14.683
Your sister disappeared?

00:41:16.414 --> 00:41:18.410
When we came back,

00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:20.850
Chatfah was gone.

00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:23.883
We tried to find her.

00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:26.625
We looked for her everywhere.

00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:28.770
But we couldn’t find her.

00:41:32.770 --> 00:41:34.465
Chat, where are you?

00:41:34.509 --> 00:41:37.280
(How important is your family to you?)

00:41:37.316 --> 00:41:38.349
Chat.

00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:40.830
Chat.

00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:43.745
When Chatfah fell down,

00:41:45.370 --> 00:41:46.516
What were you doing?

00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:48.920
I…

00:41:52.850 --> 00:41:54.810
I was sleeping alone in my room.

00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:58.763
(Are you willing to risk your life to protect it?)

00:41:58.923 --> 00:42:00.989
Did you go to meet her?

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:04.500
I…

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:07.149
I didn’t go.

00:42:07.592 --> 00:42:08.480
PI, I’M WAITING FOR YOU.

00:42:08.523 --> 00:42:11.210
(Will you make someone disappear for it?)

00:42:12.010 --> 00:42:15.760
Are you sure you told me everything?

00:42:17.590 --> 00:42:18.590
Yes.

00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:21.105
I’m sure.

00:42:22.690 --> 00:42:27.563
(For me, humans cannot be trusted.)

00:42:27.790 --> 00:42:31.490
Do you think who the suspect is?

00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:33.200
Bua.

00:42:33.690 --> 00:42:35.970
(Although we were born in the same family.)

00:42:36.007 --> 00:42:37.738
(We grew up together.)

00:42:37.781 --> 00:42:38.781
Picha.

00:42:39.003 --> 00:42:42.290
(We say how important our family is to us.)

00:42:42.327 --> 00:42:43.563
Chompoo.

00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:46.785
The person
who wants the company’s shares the most

00:42:47.530 --> 00:42:48.858
That person is Bua.

00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:52.101
Picha wants Bupphachat Mansion the most.

00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:53.760
Because of Nathat,

00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:56.676
she can kill Chatfah.

00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:02.865
(But in the end, )

00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:06.385
(everyone puts themselves first.)

00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:15.578
Why did she run into this place?

00:43:16.090 --> 00:43:19.643
You haven’t told us where you were.

00:43:19.941 --> 00:43:22.450
What about you? Where were you?

00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:24.261
It’s not important.

00:43:24.407 --> 00:43:25.170
What about you?

00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:27.490
I told you.

00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:29.672
I went to get a towel to stop the bleeding.

00:43:29.818 --> 00:43:31.061
Dad, you knew it, right?

00:43:31.410 --> 00:43:33.032
If you did this,

00:43:33.781 --> 00:43:35.780
our family would never be the same.
