00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.760
I think we need to talk

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.600
about you doing your thing.

00:00:14.993 --> 00:00:17.960
When will you let me do it?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.640
We'll do it 3 times a week.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.560
Okay?

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.800
Okay, Rin.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.760
Ah!

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.520
Ouch!

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.520
Khem.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.360
I think we should take you to the hospital.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.520
Please stop fighting.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:30.681
Let's take you to the hospital.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.960
Let's go.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.680
Hey, Khem.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:45.960
Khem.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.520
Gosh!

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.640
What's taking her so long?

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.280
What's gotten into her?

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.480
Come in.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.200
Mai?

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.350
Where's Khem?

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.140
Her assignment is now overdue.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.990
I'm here to tell you that

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.800
Khem has been injured.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.600
She's currently
at the company's medical facility.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.080
Hold on...

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.120
What? What do you mean?

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.440
What happened?

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.560
Something happened, and she blacked out.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.640
Excuse me.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.560
Do you know where
the patient named Khemjira is?

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.920
Ms. Khemjira is currently
in the emergency room.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.400
Thank you.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.000
Thank you, doctor.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.360
Khem.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.400
How are you?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I'm hurt.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.200
I'm really hurt.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.760
Are you hungry?

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:16.640
Yes.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:17.800
I am.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.120
If there's a horse in front of me,

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.680
I think I'd be able to swallow it whole.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.360
You still dare to act funny?

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.840
Hold on, then. I'll be right back.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.600
I'll deal with the medical bills for you.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.520
Thank you very much, my dear wife.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.200
Mm...

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.560
Stay here. Don't mess around, okay?

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.280
Thank you very much
for taking her to the hospital.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.240
You may now go back to work.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.320
And...

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.760
Khem might not be back at the office.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.960
Inform the head of the department
on her behalf.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.300
Yes, Boss.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.560
Oh, one more thing.

00:03:18.232 --> 00:03:20.760
Please share the news

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.360
about Khem and me.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.880
Share the news?

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.600
About what, Boss?

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.320
Khem is my husband.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:36.680
- Huh?
- Huh?!

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.160
Hey...

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.760
Our CEO is married to an employee,

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.760
and this has been kept a secret.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.600
- It's like a plot in a drama.
- Yeah.

00:03:49.505 --> 00:03:50.800
Khem!

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.320
Do you know

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.360
you're the luckiest girl in the company?

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.720
Yes, I do.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.840
Be careful.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.960
- Aww!
- Aww!!

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.640
- We're in a romance drama.
- Are we in a romance drama?

Take it slow. No need to hurry.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.721
My legs are fine, Rin.

00:05:28.761 --> 00:05:31.680
- My hand isn't.
- I know. Be careful.

Yes.

Mm...

Well...

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.280
Take a few days off.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.240
I'll inform the head of the department.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:52.480
Go and have a rest.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:54.920
Alright.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.800
Luckily, my left hand is still fine.

Or else this ring would be badly damaged.

you're still a crybaby.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.360

Jay.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.000
This means...

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.920
Boss and Khem getting married
on the same day means...

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:51.920
Hey!

00:06:51.945 --> 00:06:52.825
Oh, dear.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.800
We've gossiped so much
about Boss with Khem!

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.247
What should we do?

00:06:57.272 --> 00:06:58.272
Yeah...

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.040
If she finds out,

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.400
the first thing she'll probably do
is cut our bonuses.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.800
Huh? Cut our bonuses?

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.760
But I need the money!

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.120
If she punishes us, what will we do?

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:11.440
Yeah...

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.640
In hindsight,

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:16.880
Boss never cared about anyone

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.480
except Khem.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:19.960
Mm.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.960
You have such poor judgment.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.360
That's why men don't date you.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.960
And who told you that
I wanted to date a man?

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.240
What? You don't want to date one?

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:35.520
Nope.

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.360
I don't want a man.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:39.400
Why?

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.760
You have a crush on me or something?

00:07:43.663 --> 00:07:44.520
Mm.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:46.920
Huh?

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:49.600
What?

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.400
I have a crush on you. What about it?

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.080
Hold up, Jay.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.360
You're actually into me?

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.840
Is this real or fake?

00:07:59.040 --> 00:07:59.920
Perhaps.

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.560
If you do love me,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.200
I'm taking this seriously, okay?

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.000
Seriously? About what?

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:39.200
You act girly.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.480
Quit horsing around.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:44.920
So what?

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.520
Have I ever told you that I like men?

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:53.080
Honestly,

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.120
I do have some feelings for you.

00:08:58.520 --> 00:08:59.520
But...

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:03.080
I thought you liked men,

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.440
so I didn't confess my feelings.

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.360
Balloon.

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.520
Let's do our job.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.480
Stop talking nonsense.

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.560
Tomorrow, I'll handle this myself.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.400
How could that girl do this to Khem?

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.120
Rin...

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.040
Dad, if you're going to
make a call on this matter,

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:59.521
please do so from
the perspective of the President

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.960
dealing with two ordinary employees?

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:06.680
Don't treat me as your daughter-in-law.

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:11.000
I cannot keep my promise, Khem.

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:12.680
Though I'll think about it.

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:15.800
I love you like a daughter.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.040
If you, my daughter, are being harassed...

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.680
A leader needs to be fair, however.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.600
And what is fair to you?

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:31.400
The culprit has to take
a certain amount of accountability.

00:10:31.615 --> 00:10:35.415
You cannot use your full power
to decide on the matter.

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:37.560
That would be irrational, Dad.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:38.894
I know.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.160
If I were neutral

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.920
about the harassment of my daughter-in-law,

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.000
it wouldn't sit right with me.

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:49.960
I know.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.040
That's why

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.680
I want to see you overcome it.

00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:59.840
I'll give it a try.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.360
That's great.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.760
I think that's the best course of action.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.080
Ow...

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:38.920
Rin.

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:42.720
Can you help me?

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.880
Are you alright now?

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.440
I'm feeling better now,

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.760
but taking a bath...

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:00.800
Hey.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:03.320
Don't be so opportunistic.

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:07.440
I just can't do it, Rin.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.480
It hurts.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.120
It really hurts.

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:13.600
Okay, okay.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:16.760
It's just...

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.080
taking a bath, okay?

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:23.320
Yes, just take a bath.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.720
Thank you, Rin.

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:47.520
Thank you for seeing me at the hospital.

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.040
And now you're giving me a bath, too.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.320
Mm...

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.600
I see this like

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.280
giving a puppy a bath.

00:12:59.271 --> 00:13:02.671
But this young pup is really adorable,
isn't it?

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.560
Really?

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.080
Ow...

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:13.480
Hey...

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.240
Oh...

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:19.600
Ouch.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.040
Hey.

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:23.720
You got an injury here, too.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.400
Is it a deep cut?

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.600
I don't know.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:31.920
Maybe it's only skin deep.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.920
I got it during the car accident.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.400
And...

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.520
You've been enduring the pain all night?

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:42.840
Yes.

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:45.160
If it were just a splinter,

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:48.000
I would've taken it out forever ago.

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:58.440
Khem.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:03.200
You've been there for me for so long.

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:06.700
Now, let me do it, too.

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:43.640
Rin.

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:48.600
Are you going to give me a show?

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:51.720
Nope.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:56.000
I'm simply paying you back.

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:08.680
You're not declining, are you?

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:23.960
Now, do you know how it feels?

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:26.280
I do...

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:17.280
Hey.

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:21.680
It's only the second time,
and you're already out of breath?

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:26.240
I'm not.

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:28.360
Are you sure?

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:34.400
How about we do it for the third time?

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.000
Rin!

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:38.920
That's enough.

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.880
If we keep going,
it might be too much for me.

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:44.840
Okay.

00:16:46.312 --> 00:16:47.912
Watch your hand.

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:51.360
- Hold it here.
- I forgot that I was in pain.

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.800
So, it's time to take a bath.

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:49.440
Why are you so shaky?

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.640
I don't know.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.680
I don't know it either.

00:17:58.540 --> 00:17:59.720
How about...

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.200
we go for another round?

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:05.960
Oh, Rin!

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:08.920
I can't do it anymore.

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:11.120
I can't continue.

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.880
Come on! Let's go for one more round.

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:17.400
Please stop, Rin.

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:18.840
One more.

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:20.160
Get up. Hurry!

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:21.720
Well...

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:23.960
It's my turn, okay?

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:26.330
Oh!

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:28.760
Khem!

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:30.560
That's enough.

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.080
Your hand is injured, remember?

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:34.520
This hand is fine, though.

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.200
There!

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:52.840
Rin, you're a meanie.

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:56.560
I can't.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.280
I just can't.

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:09.280
Why did you harass my daughter-in-law?

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:14.640
Khemjira...

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:18.000
is my daughter's husband.

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:22.840
Nobody might have known about this,

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:26.320
but even if Khemjira is just an employee,

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:28.480
you have no right to harass her.

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:32.640
Can you explain the reasons
for your actions?

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:37.760
I'm sorry, Mr. President.

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:41.520
I was just angry that she came in

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:45.960
and got my partner laid off.

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:49.960
Your partner?

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:07.040
Do you think we lay off
employees without justification?

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.880
Our rules and regulations

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:11.680
have been approved by the legal department.

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:14.560
If an employee were to get fired
without a reason,

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:16.600
don't you think they'd take legal action?

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:19.480
I already told them to do it,

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:20.520
but they refused.

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:23.040
That's because they're in the wrong.

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:27.360
You probably don't know the reasons

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.640
behind your partner's termination.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
Your partner got fired

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:37.320
because of an inappropriate
workplace relationship

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.440
during work hours.

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.800
They were caught on CCTV, too.

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:47.120
They wouldn't dare tell you the truth.

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:51.880
Now, I hope that's clear.

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:54.920
At my company,

00:20:56.040 --> 00:21:00.440
I'm allowed to assign Khemjira
to any role or line of work.

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:05.320
There's no need for me to fire your partner
and replace them with her.

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:11.640
More importantly...

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:13.880
I'd like you to remember this.

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:17.080
If it weren't for Khemjira's request,

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:20.320
you wouldn't have just received a warning.

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:36.560
Dad.

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:39.280
Are you done with the meeting?

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:40.760
Mm.

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:42.720
Don't tell me that

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:45.040
you just gave her a warning.

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:48.920
That's what Khem requested.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.520
Now, it's my turn

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:57.840
to make her pay.

00:22:03.772 --> 00:22:04.920
What are you going to do?

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:09.240
As her wife,

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:12.280
I have my own ways.

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.080
I think this is pretty good, too.

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:23.870
Right.

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:27.560
Gee, is this alright?

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:30.240
Hey.

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.480
I'm asking you if this is okay or not.

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:35.840
It looks okay to me.

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:39.040
So, we...

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:55.760
Was it you who made the mess yesterday?

00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:59.080
I'm sorry, Boss.

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:03.160
I have no idea that Khem is...

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:05.880
your husband.

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:10.760
Even if she isn't my loved one,

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:13.880
you have no right to harass any employee

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:16.680
or anyone in particular.

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:19.760
On that day,

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:22.440
was it you who locked Khemjira
in the archive?

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:24.040
Answer me!

00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:29.520
Yes, it was me, Boss.

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:31.080
I'm really sorry.

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:37.000
Did you know that Khem has claustrophobia

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:40.360
because she was in a serious accident?

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:43.520
Perhaps you knew that,

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:46.320
which is why you harassed her like that.

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:48.680
I have no idea about that, Boss.

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:50.440
I'm deeply sorry.

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:51.880
I've learned my lesson.

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:03.040
Now that you've admitted your guilt,

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:05.520
focus on your work

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:09.080
and don't cause any more problems
for the company.

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:12.640
I don't want my employees

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.960
wasting time harassing each other.

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:18.480
Here, we're family,

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:21.320
and it has always been my intention

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:24.480
to keep it that way.

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:36.680
Do not jeopardize the structure.

00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:59.960
I think it's best we call it here.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.800
Oh, okay.

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:06.240
Oh, gossip time.

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:08.400
Come here. Quickly.

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:11.440
Balloon.

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:16.240
Boss is such a badass.

00:25:17.392 --> 00:25:19.272
I've been alive for over 30 years,

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:24.960
but I've never seen anyone this angry
yet so collected.

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:26.800
Hey.

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:28.760
Get your mind out of the gutter.

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:30.160
She's Khem's wife.

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:32.200
I was talking about Boss,

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:33.720
not Khem.

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:36.120
But I'm talking to you, not Boss.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:00.560
Hey!

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:01.720
Let's get back to work.

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:02.840
Back to work, everybody.

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:04.520
Let's see...

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:05.560
Mm.

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:08.600
I'm actually single, though.

00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:10.420
If you've got something on your mind,

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:11.960
feel free to tell me.

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:18.520
Huh?

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:22.240
Jay!

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:24.000
I'm actually available!

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:33.800
Balloon.

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:37.000
You're the biggest bigmouth in the company.

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:38.960
It's a big deal, you see.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.520
So I have to keep you posted, no?

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:42.960
Also, do you know that Jay and I...

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.000
Huh?!

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:47.440
Don't tell me you're going to make a move?

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:48.640
Yes.

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:50.840
Boss and you aren't the only ones
running the show.

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:52.983
Whoa.

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:57.960
Also, about us gossiping about Boss...

00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.720
We're dead afraid right now.

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:03.080
Oh, go ahead and tell them

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:05.200
I don't discuss those matters with Rin.

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:06.760
No need to worry, okay?

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:09.000
Oh, what a relief.

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:12.040
My heart was about to pop
when Boss walked into the office.

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:14.120
By the way, get well soon, alright?

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:15.360
I'm so lonely out here.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:17.640
Jay is always too flustered
and keeps running away from me.

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:21.520
Sure thing, Balloon.
See you soon.

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:37.800
Whoa, Rin!

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:41.240
I miss you so much.

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:45.440
I've been waiting so long
to have a meal with you that my tummy hurts.

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:48.200
Why are you waiting for me?

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:50.080
Why don't you have your dinner
and take your medicine?

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:51.120
Hey.

00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:52.920
You didn't take care of yourself, did you?

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:56.800
I want my dear wife to take care of me,
you know?

00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:59.560
I love you, Rin.

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:01.960
Gosh! You're annoying.

00:28:05.104 --> 00:28:05.984
Well...

00:28:06.009 --> 00:28:07.969
Rin. Let's go and have a meal.

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:10.520
Hold on.

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:14.680
Hello, Prapai?

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:20.600
What's going on?

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:31.800
Where's the hospital?

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:34.840
Mm.

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:38.800
Please don't go.

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:41.440
It's already late evening.

00:28:41.465 --> 00:28:42.840
You can see her tomorrow.

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.200
I'll go there with you.

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:47.880
I'm going.

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:49.800
You also need to have a rest.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.680
Have dinner and take your pills.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000
Rin.

00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:56.640
Please stay.

00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:59.720
I don't want you to go.

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:01.400
I want to stay with you.

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:04.480
Hey.

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:07.120
Can you stop messing with me?

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:09.160
I'm going,
and who do you think you are to stop me?

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:13.760
If you go,

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:17.200
you won't be able to move on

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:19.120
and will keep getting hurt.

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:23.040
She will never come back and love you.

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:26.120
Please stop talking to her.

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:32.960
It's you who needs to stop talking to me.

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:47.080
Excuse me.

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:49.120
Which room is
the patient named Prapai staying in?

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:50.520
Oh, Ms. Prapai?

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:52.000
Her room is that way.

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:54.960
Thank you.

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:23.480
Doctor.

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:24.920
How's Prapai?

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:26.760
She fainted

00:30:26.785 --> 00:30:28.025
due to the lack of sleep.

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:30.000
However, she can go home tomorrow.

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:33.000
Did any of her relatives
or her partner come to see her?

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:35.120
I didn't see any.

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:40.720
If that's all, please excuse me.

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:42.720
Thank you.

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:55.800
I'm going to talk to Rin.

00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:57.760
This is getting out of hand.

00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:58.600
Hey!

00:30:58.840 --> 00:30:59.960
Please don't.

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:02.800
That wasn't her best intention.

00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:06.560
We just had some arguments, Kwanrin.

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:07.800
Just some arguments?

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:11.280
Was the cut deep and painful?

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:13.400
Be mad at her for your own sake.

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:15.400
No matter how much you love her,

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:18.720
there's no need to
suppress certain emotions for her.

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:21.680
I'm upset

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:23.640
and a bit sad.

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:25.960
Why didn't you tell her, then?

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:30.000
Even if I did, she wouldn't listen.

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:32.669
Khem.

00:31:32.708 --> 00:31:35.000
You're acting strange, you know?

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:37.080
Strange? How?

00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:41.800
Back then, you used to cheer her up
when she was hurt.

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:46.040
You messed around with her
so she could forget about her past.

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:49.080
Now, you're becoming like her.

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:53.151
You're doing everything you can
to cling to someone you love,

00:31:53.185 --> 00:31:55.425
even though you're hurting awfully.

00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:57.960
You're right.

00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:00.640
I'm becoming who Rin is.

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:04.720
You love her a lot,

00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:06.680
so it makes sense.

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:11.480
It's true, of course.

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:13.680
I really love her.

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:16.040
I really do.

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:18.880
But sometimes,

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:23.760
I'm nothing more than a disposable napkin
she uses to wipe away her tears.

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:26.480
It's okay, Khem.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.800
Try again.

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:34.480
You still have a lot more time
to make her forget her past love.

00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:36.560
I'm rooting for you, alright?

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:38.480
Thank you, Kwanrin.

00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:25.560
"I made you an omelet.
It's on the dining table."

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:29.560
"If you're hungry, go and have it, okay?"

00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:57.680
Khem.

00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:03.460
Are you hurt?

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:08.720
I'm sorry.

00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:16.160
I hope you know
I didn’t mean to do it.

00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:07.040
I'm sorry.

00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:08.560
I did it a bit too hard.

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:13.560
What do you mean by that?

00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:17.920
I mean...

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:21.400
I got up a bit too suddenly.

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:22.720
Oh.

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:25.000
I woke up by myself, actually.

00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:29.840
Mm...

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:35.440
As an apology for hurting you
the second time,

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:39.080
I'll let you hitch a ride with me to work.

00:35:40.923 --> 00:35:41.629
Ow...

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:43.720
Really?!

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:45.960
Mm.

00:35:46.872 --> 00:35:49.472
You work late in the morning, though.

00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:52.800
I'm cool with having a driver
take me there.

00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:56.360
Why do you have to go to work
so early, though?

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:57.960
Is there even anything to do at work?

00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:00.520
Mm...

00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:04.640
At first, I was afraid of the traffic.

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:07.520
Heading out early means

00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:09.240
there's less traffic,

00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:11.440
so I'll be able to drive slowly.

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:14.760
If I head out late,

00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:18.480
the traffic's bad, and I have to rush.

00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:22.040
I'm scared.

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:25.320
I'm scared that I'll be in a car accident.

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:35.600
Don't be scared,

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:37.040
just come to work with me.

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:39.440
I'm not a reckless driver.

00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:47.040
You're good at driving, I know.

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:49.240
Mm.

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:52.360
Let's take a shower together

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:53.560
so that we won't be late.

00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:54.660
Let's go.

00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:57.640
Wait, Rin.

00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:58.720
Huh?

00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:02.600
This is the third time this week.

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:08.440
You're right.

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:11.480
Yay!

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:13.800
Ow! Ouch!

00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:16.360
Are you okay?

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:38.880
You usually don't eat breakfast, right?

00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:43.080
I've...

00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:45.040
I've changed my mind.

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:48.120
You also have to eat a lot

00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:49.440
and finish your plate.

00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:53.040
This is such a weird morning.

00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:55.960
You seem to care about me more than ever.

00:37:58.249 --> 00:37:59.240
You've talked too much.

00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:11.760
How sweet of you...

00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:15.080
Can you feed me as well?

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:17.360
Don't ask for too much.

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:22.280
- Are you okay now?
- I'm fine.

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:27.840
Good morning.

00:39:31.454 --> 00:39:32.327
Rin...

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:35.080
How am I supposed to act normal?

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:37.360
Well...

00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:39.640
It's fine.

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:45.160
Come have lunch with me at noon.

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:47.520
I'll have Mai prepare your dishes.

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:49.320
Why is that?

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:51.800
Well...

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:53.760
No reason.

00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:01.085
I have to go now.

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:04.240
Work hard, okay?

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:08.800
Right.

00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:11.240
Miss you.

00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:49.400
Good morning, everybody!

00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:51.320
Good morning, Khem!

00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:55.400
Come and sit here.

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:00.800
Alright, alright.

00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:02.840
Boss' husband,

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:05.040
you've been away for days, you know?

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:08.560
If we hadn't known that
you're living in the same house as Boss,

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:11.400
Balloon and I would've come and found you.

00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:14.720
Here you go.

00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:15.940
It's a get-well gift.

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:19.800
Thank you very much.

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:25.640
Hold up.

00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:32.120
You two are holding hands?

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:33.880
Are you guys finally dating?

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:35.240
Nuts!

00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:36.520
Nope!

00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:37.960
You're talking nonsense.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.680
Aww...

00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:42.600
What is there to be ashamed of
now that you've taken it this far?

00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:48.160
Right?

00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:49.960
Stop being flustered.

00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:18.320
Khem.

00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:19.920
Yes?

00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:22.560
I've got something to say.

00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:27.680
I'm sorry

00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:30.320
for hurting you

00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:33.720
because of my misunderstanding.

00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:39.640
It's okay.

00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:43.120
I'd also like to apologize

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:45.280
for slapping you in the face.

00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:47.840
At least now, we're even.

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:51.200
Thank you.

00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:54.680
However, I've quit my job.

00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:00.600
The head of the department is going to

00:43:01.449 --> 00:43:03.249
assign a new leader tomorrow.

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:14.000
Best of luck to you, Gee.

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:42.520
It's a bit weird, isn't it?

00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:44.520
Mm, yeah.

00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:47.640
She looks like she's made a mistake

00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:49.800
and actually feels guilty about it.

00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:54.040
I think she's learned a lesson
from what she did.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:37.560
[Director: Thanamin Wongsakulpach]

00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:40.120
Today, I...

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:42.920
I feel like I've met
another version of myself,

00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:46.280
someone so bottled-up that

00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:50.040
they make others feel

00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:52.280
insecure,

00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:55.160
even though

00:44:57.640 --> 00:44:59.720
it's actually me who feels that way.

00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:06.840
I thought I was over it with Prapai.

00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:11.120
However, I hurt Khem again,

00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:17.360
even though she never did the same to me.

00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:22.520
I don't want her to end up like me.

00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:27.320
I don't want her to feel like
she has to do everything

00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:30.120
to make someone stay,

00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:33.400
even though she's in a lot of pain.

00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:48.680
From the next morning on,

00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:52.240
I'll start over,

00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:58.920
not just as her wife,

00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:04.520
but as a lover who wants
to make her know that

00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:09.040
she is my home,

00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:12.760
my peace of mind,

00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:17.800
and someone I don't want to lose again.

00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:29.520
Praenarin.

00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:31.520
Give it your best shot.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.400
The person waiting for you is

00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:40.240
someone who truly loves you.

00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:57.960
What's with the sad face?

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.240
So... Shall we take a bath together?

00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:02.440
Do you want us to do our thing?

00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:05.120
My right hand still hurts quite a bit,

00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:09.680
but my lips and left hand are still fine.

00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:12.840
[Prapai]

00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:16.240
At the end of the day, you'll be nothing more than
a napkin for her to wipe her tears with,

00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:19.080
which she'll throw away when she's done.

00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:23.120
Get out of my life.
