WEBVTT

00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.550
Yeah, no problem over there.

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:06.000
Thank you for helping
me make the adjustments.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.700
Was I played that day?

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.570
This list.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.190
Do you want to do it together with me?

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.600
I'm just like Tojo-san.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.600
Alright, I'll hang up now.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.600
Mr. Iwamoto, is that okay?

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.300
It was probably just a joke...

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.800
Takoyaki party and cake

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.479
Have an ice cream sundae with Tojo-san.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.960
Sounds like it would be a lot of fun.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.800
He was probably just joking!

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.900
- Don't mess with my computer.
- This one's already done.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.300
Celebrate my birthday with my partner.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.300
A lover, huh... He never said he
wanted to date me or that he liked me.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.800
Are you willing to trust me now?

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.400
I really don't get that guy.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.500
I have absolutely no problem holding you.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.300
What on earth is he thinking?

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:30.900
Ah! Seriously!

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.500
"10 Things I Want to Do Before I Turn 40"
(Episode 2)

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.400
(Takoyaki Party)

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.100
Speaking of which...

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.500
Speaking of which, Keishi...

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.200
What kind of person is he, really?

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.000
Tojo-san.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.100
I'm heading out for the day.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.800
Good work.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.300
Good work.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.400
As expected, it's just like always.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.400
Keishi always greets people very politely.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.900
Good work.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.420
Huh?

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.079
Has Keishi already left?

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.199
Yeah, he said he had plans to meet someone.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.500
What!

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.299
Is that guy off on another
date with a woman again?

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.900
I have no idea.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.600
Did something happen?

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.300
It's nothing.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.660
- Keishi! Sorry to keep you waiting.
- Hey! Thanks for your hard work.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:02.738
Long time no see.

00:04:02.762 --> 00:04:05.720
Hey, it hasn't been that long! Didn't
we just see each other not too long ago?

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.700
I'm really looking forward to it.

00:04:06.701 --> 00:04:07.799
Let's go, let's go.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.009
What do you want to eat?

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.370
- Have you decided?
- Yep, all set.

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:12.600
- Pasta!
- Pasta!

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.100
Keishi, he...

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.700
You're right about that.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.181
Someone like him, who has
so many options to choose from.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
How could she ever date an old guy like me?

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.000
Right, Susuko.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:50.000
But you still care about
Keishi-kun, don't you?

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.500
This is the progress so far.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:10.330
To be honest, I think this
event doesn't have enough buzz.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.600
- This is intentional.
- Keishi... he's really good at his job.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.739
What matters most to
the client is the brand.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.000
He always manages to calmly
say exactly what needs to be said.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.699
- That's the old data.
- Huh?

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.009
- This is the latest one.
- Thank you! I really appreciate it~

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:31.950
He's naturally considerate of
others, so people just can't dislike him.

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:35.069
- This is the one Udagawa made for us before, right?
- Yeah.

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:36.280
I think it's pretty great.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.100
And he actually has a
surprisingly clumsy side, too.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.300
He's got really beautiful hands, too.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.700
And when he smiles,
he's especially adorable.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.000
He's also really tall.

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.700
He's got great poise, too.

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:13.800
Another good-looking guy.

00:06:13.801 --> 00:06:15.199
Ah! Keishi.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.700
Good job.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:17.700
A while ago.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.999
- I went to Hakata.
- Business trip, huh!

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:21.850
- Yeah, yeah, it was a business trip.
- Thanks for your hard work.

00:06:21.851 --> 00:06:23.300
- Do you want this?
- Is that okay?

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.799
- Have one!
- Then I'll take it, thanks.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.640
Huh? Give it to me!

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.100
So of course he's really popular.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:34.400
So...

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
There's not even a millimeter
of a chance you'd date me.

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:44.300
Tojo-san.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:46.800
I'm heading out for the day.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:48.910
Good job.

00:06:48.911 --> 00:06:50.000
Thanks for your hard work.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:52.660
Good job.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.800
It's been a week since that day.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.200
Everything is just like usual.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:03.900
Keishi goes to work and
comes home like usual every day.

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:16.100
Anyway.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.900
It's like that whole thing
never even happened.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:31.900
Tojo-san.

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.800
Are we heading to the electronics store?

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:37.100
An electronics store?

00:07:38.466 --> 00:07:41.266
The Big Camera across from the station.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:47.000
Let's go buy a takoyaki maker.

00:07:50.192 --> 00:07:52.692
Could it be... Tojo-san already has one?

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.300
No... I don't.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.700
Why do you want to buy a takoyaki maker?

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:01.000
Because it's the first thing on my list.

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:06.700
He's not even planning to...
Just pretending it never happened!

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:15.699
Which one do you think is better?

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:16.963
No, no.

00:08:16.988 --> 00:08:20.801
I looked it up, and it seems like
the smaller ones heat up faster.

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:24.589
But if you want to make really good takoyaki, I've
heard you definitely need to use a gas model.

00:08:24.614 --> 00:08:26.524
Hey, wait a second! I'm serious…

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Tojo-san, the goals you set to
accomplish before you turn 40.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.760
But since I don't have anyone to do
it with, everything's on hold for now.

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:36.800
That's right, isn't it?

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Seriously...

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:44.499
Are you saying you want to
check off the list together with me?

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.000
It's fine, don't overthink it.

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.700
Look, this is the gas stove type.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:53.700
Oh~

00:08:53.701 --> 00:08:55.399
Are you an idiot?!

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:59.160
You're only going to use it once, and you're
still going to buy a whole machine just for that!

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.100
Huh! Isn't it actually the opposite?

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:05.300
If you buy it, you can use it
anytime you want, no problem.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.500
- Huh?
- No...

00:09:12.815 --> 00:09:16.615
I just feel like I've never had
that kind of thought before…

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:21.100
Really?

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:24.200
What should I do?

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:24.500
Huh?

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000
This one.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.569
No, that's not it. If I had to choose
from these, I'd pick this one...

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:32.099
- Sorry about that.
- That was way too fast...

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:34.039
I want this takoyaki maker.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.000
Thank you.

00:09:35.024 --> 00:09:37.024
No, no, no...

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.500
Aren't you going to buy it?

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:43.700
I want this one.

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:47.676
You can either take it yourself or have it
delivered. Which option would you prefer?

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:48.829
- I'll pick it up myself.
- I'll pick it up myself.

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:49.830
Alright.

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.100
Thank you.

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:55.000
In the end, I still went along
with what he wanted and bought it.

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:56.900
I'll carry it.

00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:58.149
No need!

00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:59.500
The station is just up ahead.

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:01.780
After all, I'm your subordinate.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.770
Oh... thank you.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.200
No way.

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:09.000
Keishi is kind to everyone.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.800
I should probably just
walk you to the station.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:25.600
Huh?

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:30.900
This guy probably doesn't
live at the same station, right?

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.499
Which way is it?

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:36.200
- My place is pretty much this way...
- Got it.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.880
Are you saying you're going to help
me carry it all the way to my place?

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.679
Is it this way?

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.500
Yes, this is the place.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.249
Where's the supermarket?

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:54.300
- The supermarket's just up ahead…
- OK.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Huh?

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.200
No way.

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:03.100
Oh! Are we here?

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.200
Huh? Is it happening today?

00:11:04.201 --> 00:11:05.281
You're only telling me now?

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:06.809
Let's hurry up.

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:07.900
The octopus will thaw.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.400
Young people are really something else.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.199
Sorry to interrupt.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.349
I need to tidy up a bit over here.
Give me five minutes.

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:19.699
It's okay, you don't have
to worry about me. I'm fine.

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:22.200
No way! I told you to wait five minutes!

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:27.500
Aaaaahhhhh!!!!

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:34.580
That's too much... Didn't I
tell you to wait five minutes?

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:36.349
It's like a dream.

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:39.279
Oh, no! This actually belongs to my nephew.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:40.700
I see.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000
So cute!

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:50.200
Susuko!

00:11:50.201 --> 00:11:51.499
Oh! Sorry.

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:52.500
Huh?

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:54.400
What did you say?

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.200
No, that's not it...

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.200
Have you given it a name?

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:00.400
This plush toy.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.400
Wow! So cute!

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:06.500
Well then.

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:08.500
Are we about to start?

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:23.800
Tojo-san? Are you ready to get started?

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.360
You're really skilled!

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:45.000
Yeah, I guess you could say that.

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.200
Are you someone who doesn't cook?

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:49.560
No, I can cook.

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:52.200
That's a surprise, but nice!

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.840
No, not really. I can only
make some simple dishes.

00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:57.000
How about you?

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:59.000
Me? I always cook for myself.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.269
I have a super strong-willed twin sister.

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:05.630
Ever since we were kids, she taught me that
a man who can't do housework is useless.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.400
A container for holding green onions.

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:15.299
Well... this one will do.

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:16.270
Thank you.

00:13:16.271 --> 00:13:17.600
A twin sister?

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Yeah.

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:22.010
Even though they're twins,
we actually don't look alike at all.

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:25.600
Our personalities are
completely opposite, but...

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:28.689
The only thing they really have in
common is how strong-willed they both are.

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:32.010
Not long ago, she also dragged me out and
insisted I help her figure something out.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.394
I was actually pretty
tired at that time…

00:13:34.418 --> 00:13:38.000
Wait, don't tell me… you met
up with her after work before?

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:41.600
Yes.

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:47.280
- What's up?
- I just happened to see it…

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:50.440
Hey! You should've at least said hi to me!

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:51.700
Is that so...

00:13:52.513 --> 00:13:56.000
The twin sister... big sister...

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
I'm not playing around
with women, you know.

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:11.800
No…

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:12.960
Ah...

00:14:12.961 --> 00:14:15.081
There should be something
else we need to cut, right?

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:17.500
Well then...

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.659
I'll cut this.

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:20.799
Should I slice the pickled ginger?

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:21.850
Huh, not going to cut it?

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:23.300
Ready!

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:28.730
Oh! It even comes with a strap for tying.

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:31.789
This is the instruction manual, right?

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:33.809
No, no, that's not right!

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:36.500
The instructions... I never read them.

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:41.499
- That was pretty well done.
- Yeah, really impressive.

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:42.700
- Ah!
- Hm?

00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:48.399
So cute!
Having this really makes a difference...

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:51.420
And then this one goes here too.
Now it's perfect.

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:54.070
I can really feel the
excitement kicking in now.

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:55.700
Actually, me too.

00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:00.150
Hey! Wouldn't it be better
if we made it two layers?

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:01.020
Want to try adding it in?

00:15:01.021 --> 00:15:02.820
- Let's just add it in.
- No… wait…

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:03.920
Alright.

00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:08.385
Toilet paper, toilet paper.

00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:09.400
Where is it?

00:15:09.401 --> 00:15:11.000
In the back.

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:13.800
Let's turn off the heat for now.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.200
Ah!

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:20.300
You've still been
keeping this all this time?

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:23.539
Ah... yeah.

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:25.176
I thought it had been
thrown away a long time ago.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.876
If someone gives me something,
there's no way I'd just throw it away!

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:29.626
More important than
that is the toilet paper.

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:31.100
Sorry, here you go.

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:37.800
And also that...

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.500
Actually, I kind of like it.

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:46.100
Is that so?

00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:47.200
Speaking of which...

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:49.700
You actually still remember
something like that?

00:15:51.691 --> 00:15:52.991
I won't forget.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.560
Because I was the one who picked it up.

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:05.800
Looks really similar.

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:12.300
No way! Hurry up, hurry up!

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:14.299
Here, give it a spin.

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:15.376
- Thank you.
- Turn the takoyaki.

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:16.839
Hey! But right now... huh?

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:18.499
Wait, wait, wait a second,
please hold on a moment.

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:20.900
Because we just put it
in, let's wait a little longer.

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:22.400
Ah! Octopus!

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:28.000
- Any kind of yaki is fine.
- If there's no octopus inside, then it's not takoyaki.

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:35.400
Takoyaki.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.600
You really love taking photos!

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.600
Is it ready?

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:43.800
It's ready.

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.730
Alright! I'll put it here so
the sauce doesn't splatter.

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:49.500
- Sorry about that.
- It's fine, no need to apologize.

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:52.000
Alright, that's enough, stop filming me.

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:54.600
Alright...

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.900
So, are we ready to dig in?

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.000
I'm going to dig in.

00:17:03.407 --> 00:17:04.487
Wow! That looks really hot.

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:08.600
So hot...

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:10.440
It's really hot, isn't it?

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.700
Ah! But...

00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:21.200
This is so delicious!

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:23.039
It's incredibly soft and tender inside.

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:24.040
Yeah.

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:27.299
- Wow, this is delicious!
- Freshly made like this is just unfair.

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:29.500
Yeah, it's really something else.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.200
The whole thing is steaming!

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.399
You know... it's really nice that
you always greet people so politely.

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:41.000
It's actually pretty good.

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:42.090
Huh?

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:43.000
Is that so?

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:43.350
Yeah.

00:17:43.351 --> 00:17:45.800
I also said "let's dig in" just now.

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:51.100
Great, I just got a compliment!

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.749
Whether it's at the office or
when you're far away from me.

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:57.200
You always make a point to
come over and say hi to me.

00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.760
That really made me happy.

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:08.399
When was Tojo-san's last relationship?

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.400
Pfft!

00:18:10.375 --> 00:18:11.065
Are you okay?

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:12.090
It's nothing...

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:15.500
Why are you asking all of a sudden?

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:19.500
No, that's not it. I just wanted to
know how long you've been single.

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:26.800
It was about ten years ago...

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:28.800
Huh?

00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:30.600
For real?!

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.429
Wasn't that before I joined the company?

00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:33.430
Yeah.

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:35.700
Even saying it out loud
myself makes me feel sad.

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:41.000
Hey! Are you serious...?

00:18:43.416 --> 00:18:47.000
I was just about to ask you
about what you said last time.

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.600
Is it all true?

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.080
I'm not sure which one
you're talking about, though.

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:58.000
But every word of it is true.

00:18:59.607 --> 00:19:03.507
I realized a long time
ago that Tojo-san is gay.

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:09.300
You know, sometimes women wear
those tops with lower necklines, right?

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:14.979
Because of a client, would the
15th to the 17th work for you?

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:18.049
- This should be totally fine.
- At that time, Tojo-san didn't even sneak a single glance.

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:21.100
…This earlier part is probably the best.

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:26.000
I could tell right away that you
weren't interested in women.

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:31.000
Don't worry.

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:33.360
I'm the only one who would
notice something like that.

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:35.900
Is that so?

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:43.500
Me?

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.800
I'm not ashamed of my own orientation.

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:53.500
I just don't want this to cause any
trouble for the people around me.

00:19:58.100 --> 00:19:59.700
It's the same for Tojo-san, isn't it?

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:03.600
I see.

00:20:03.888 --> 00:20:06.088
It's because I realized that.

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:08.500
So that's why Keishi...

00:20:08.997 --> 00:20:11.087
Sorry for making you worry.

00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:14.900
He really invades other
people's privacy way too much.

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:17.900
Things like that.

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:21.100
Maybe there have been a
lot of similar situations before.

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:38.800
Got some sauce on it.

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:57.300
What should we do next?

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:04.300
Keishi may be pretty assertive,
but he's still my subordinate.

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:07.200
I have no idea what he's thinking.

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:12.400
Sea Paradise...

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:17.900
Hakkeijima Sea Paradise.

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:26.600
Not bad!

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000
What kind of expression should I
have when I see him on Monday...?

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:04.200
I'm really looking
forward to next Saturday.

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:06.900
Just like that, he took the lead.

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.200
Made plans for next time.

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:12.700
The aquarium...

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:17.600
It almost feels like a date...

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:37.000
It's been a long time
since I've felt this excited.

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:40.600
That's awesome, Suzume-chan!

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:47.299
(Next Episode)
You're dressed just like a dad on vacation.

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:48.319
Is it really that bad?

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:49.589
Amazing! Incredible!

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:51.409
I had an amazing time today.

00:22:51.410 --> 00:22:53.299
It's okay even if it's just on a whim.

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:54.400
Tojo-san.

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:58.920
If you like something, just like it.
There's nothing wrong with that.
