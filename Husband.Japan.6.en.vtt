00:00:26.944 --> 00:00:28.487
Did you sleep well?

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:32.867
Sorry, I got drunk
and ended up sleeping through the night.

00:00:33.617 --> 00:00:36.245
-It's fine.
-That whiskey was just so good,

00:00:36.328 --> 00:00:37.955
I got a little carried away.

00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:41.375
I mean, the price has gone up so fast
that it's hard to get these--

00:00:43.711 --> 00:00:44.879
Ah, never mind...

00:00:46.922 --> 00:00:49.675
Japanese whiskey is also popular abroad.

00:00:50.676 --> 00:00:55.264
In ten years, it might end up being
too expensive for most people to buy.

00:00:57.266 --> 00:01:00.519
-But not for a Noble Son.
-I'm not a Noble Son.

00:01:05.024 --> 00:01:05.858
But...

00:01:08.778 --> 00:01:12.198
if you ever feel like having a drink,
feel free to give me a call.

00:01:12.865 --> 00:01:14.033
I'll join you.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.792
Are you okay?

00:01:24.877 --> 00:01:28.005
I'm sorry... for venting at you yesterday.

00:01:29.173 --> 00:01:30.466
But getting all that out...

00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:32.760
made me feel so much better!

00:01:35.638 --> 00:01:41.060
I had completely given up on ever
being able to change my life.

00:01:42.645 --> 00:01:45.940
I thought I'd just be stuck
waiting for the end.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.570
But now...

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.865
just the fact that the sun still rises,

00:01:55.658 --> 00:02:00.454
that I can walk,
that I can eat delicious food,

00:02:00.538 --> 00:02:03.833
that I can get drunk,
and that I can go to work at the office...

00:02:05.876 --> 00:02:09.088
To me, it's all a miracle.

00:02:12.174 --> 00:02:13.759
So, I'm okay.

00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:16.387
I'm going to live my way.

00:02:19.098 --> 00:02:20.891
Just as you should.

00:02:22.643 --> 00:02:24.144
To your heart's content.

00:02:27.106 --> 00:02:28.107
You too, Director.

00:02:28.607 --> 00:02:29.441
Huh?

00:02:29.525 --> 00:02:32.903
Because you always look so serious.
Like this.

00:02:39.702 --> 00:02:40.995
You're right.

00:02:42.454 --> 00:02:45.541
Let's live however we want, both of us.

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:47.001
Yeah.

00:03:07.563 --> 00:03:09.148
Well, then, I'll be seeing you.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.778
If you run into any trouble...

00:03:16.614 --> 00:03:18.908
be sure to come talk with me.

00:03:21.285 --> 00:03:23.412
Not as your superior,

00:03:24.747 --> 00:03:27.249
but as your peer from the same university.

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:36.508
Thank you for yesterday.

00:03:38.552 --> 00:03:43.390
I was glad... to have you by my side.

00:04:11.043 --> 00:04:12.127
Misa?

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:19.176
Morning. Misa didn't come back, huh?

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.556
Where...

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.599
Here?

00:04:25.683 --> 00:04:30.270
We're in Misa's room.
The night view wasn't beautiful at all.

00:04:33.023 --> 00:04:35.359
Reina, hurry. Get dressed! Come on!

00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:37.319
No, I'm sleepy...

00:04:37.403 --> 00:04:39.363
Who cares, just hurry!

00:04:40.239 --> 00:04:41.657
I said hurry up!

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.200
You're so loud...

00:04:57.798 --> 00:04:58.674
Misa!

00:05:02.511 --> 00:05:04.263
-Morning!
-Morning.

00:05:04.346 --> 00:05:06.432
-I'll hold half.
-Oh, thanks.

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:11.437
Hey, sorry about last night.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.898
I had a bit too much to drink
and I think I came off a little harsh.

00:05:14.982 --> 00:05:17.151
No problem. I also went too far.

00:05:18.902 --> 00:05:21.280
How late did you end up working?

00:05:21.363 --> 00:05:25.409
I thought I'd take a break and dozed off.
When I woke up, it was already morning.

00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:26.452
-Jeez!
-Oh, no...

00:05:26.535 --> 00:05:29.079
-You should take better care of yourself.
-I messed up...

00:05:29.163 --> 00:05:30.247
Yeah, I know.

00:05:30.748 --> 00:05:33.375
Tomoya! Morning.

00:05:35.878 --> 00:05:36.754
Morning.

00:05:37.713 --> 00:05:38.630
Good morning.

00:05:39.214 --> 00:05:40.883
Sorry I didn't call yesterday.

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.427
No, don't worry about it...

00:05:44.303 --> 00:05:45.262
Did you sleep well?

00:05:49.641 --> 00:05:53.103
-Sorry, Reina. These go over there.
-Huh? All right.

00:05:59.109 --> 00:06:00.569
My fate changed.

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:12.372
Reina and Tomoya slept together
before the wedding.

00:06:14.166 --> 00:06:17.252
TOMOYA HIRANO

00:06:21.673 --> 00:06:23.092
Hello, Tomoya?

00:06:23.842 --> 00:06:25.844
Yeah, thanks for making the reservation.

00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:35.354
I'm looking forward to meeting your mom.

00:06:42.736 --> 00:06:44.696
I tried to change my fate.

00:06:45.906 --> 00:06:49.409
But... it doesn't seem to work that way.

00:06:51.912 --> 00:06:53.413
Without a substitute.

00:06:56.166 --> 00:06:57.376
A substitute...

00:07:12.099 --> 00:07:14.518
WHICH ONE LOOKS BEST ON ME?

00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:16.770
THEY ALL LOOK GOOD!

00:07:20.232 --> 00:07:21.108
Morning.

00:07:21.191 --> 00:07:22.359
Yeah, morning.

00:07:23.527 --> 00:07:25.237
Your tie is crooked.

00:07:26.196 --> 00:07:28.532
You're so clumsy, it's cute.

00:07:28.615 --> 00:07:30.993
Reina, not at the office.

00:07:31.076 --> 00:07:32.411
Then, will you come over later?

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:37.666
That was just a one-time thing...

00:07:39.751 --> 00:07:44.339
And, well... considering
your relationship with Misa...

00:07:44.423 --> 00:07:46.341
I wanted to talk to you about that.

00:07:48.051 --> 00:07:50.470
Honestly, I feel really guilty.

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:53.807
I think I'd feel better
if I just told Misa--

00:07:53.891 --> 00:07:55.225
No, wait!

00:07:55.309 --> 00:07:58.854
Let's talk. Just... take our time
and talk this through, okay?

00:07:58.937 --> 00:08:01.023
The second planning division fails again!

00:08:01.106 --> 00:08:05.068
We finally closed the deal for the
new store, and you ruined it!

00:08:06.695 --> 00:08:09.865
Hey, what's going on,
Second Planning Division?

00:08:10.824 --> 00:08:12.534
Is there a problem?

00:08:12.618 --> 00:08:14.578
There's a problem, all right.

00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:17.080
The chairman of Asahi Department Store
was hospitalized

00:08:17.164 --> 00:08:21.335
for his peanut allergy after eating
a mushi manju served at the tasting event!

00:08:21.418 --> 00:08:22.252
What?

00:08:22.336 --> 00:08:27.132
His wife said that a female employee
gave her this list of ingredients.

00:08:27.216 --> 00:08:29.551
Someone gave her
the wrong ingredient list.

00:08:31.303 --> 00:08:34.806
Ms. Esaka. Can you bring me the list
of ingredients for the mushi manju?

00:08:35.349 --> 00:08:36.850
Thank you for your patience.

00:08:36.934 --> 00:08:38.977
Here is the ingredient list
for the mushi manju.

00:08:39.061 --> 00:08:40.771
Thank you. Okay, let's go.

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:49.780
Of all people, the chairman
of Asahi Department Store?

00:08:50.739 --> 00:08:53.784
Who was it? Who was in charge
of the live kitchen at the tasting event?

00:09:02.834 --> 00:09:04.586
I know how this looks,

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:07.673
but everyone was asked about
allergies when we gave out the lists.

00:09:07.756 --> 00:09:10.300
The first thing
out of your mouth is an excuse?

00:09:10.384 --> 00:09:14.471
How about starting with a sincere apology?

00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:16.431
Stop acting like some kid at a summer job!

00:09:16.515 --> 00:09:19.142
Do you have any idea what you've done?

00:09:19.226 --> 00:09:22.312
Mr. Tomita, we should let
Ms. Suzuki make her case before...

00:09:22.396 --> 00:09:25.315
You have my deepest apologies
on behalf of our new staff.

00:09:25.941 --> 00:09:28.568
By the way, could you tell me
which hospital the chairman...

00:09:28.652 --> 00:09:30.779
This incident was the reason Miku...

00:09:30.862 --> 00:09:32.489
Thank you very much.

00:09:40.956 --> 00:09:42.582
...was moved to a subsidiary.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.547
It wasn't Miku.

00:09:49.923 --> 00:09:51.049
That day,

00:09:51.133 --> 00:09:54.177
-the peanut paste mushi manju--
-I heard what happened.

00:09:54.803 --> 00:09:57.764
Asahi Department Store
is an important client,

00:09:58.974 --> 00:10:02.728
so please leave the investigation
into this matter to me.

00:10:04.521 --> 00:10:05.355
Very well.

00:10:12.446 --> 00:10:17.868
That day, the peanut paste mushi manju
weren't served at the venue, right?

00:10:18.744 --> 00:10:19.703
Right.

00:10:20.704 --> 00:10:22.080
So then why...

00:10:24.833 --> 00:10:26.752
Since there wasn't a substitute...

00:10:28.337 --> 00:10:30.213
destiny ran its course.

00:10:31.757 --> 00:10:35.552
Ms. Kanbe, that's all for now.

00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:38.347
But...I really don't think it was Miku.

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:40.223
That has yet to be determined.

00:10:40.307 --> 00:10:43.268
The person responsible
will be held accountable.

00:10:43.352 --> 00:10:45.020
-I'll help find out--
-Ms. Kanbe.

00:10:47.647 --> 00:10:50.859
Leave this matter to me. You...

00:10:50.942 --> 00:10:53.737
Please focus on what you need to be doing.

00:11:00.577 --> 00:11:01.912
Ms. Esaka.

00:11:03.872 --> 00:11:06.917
I'm sorry things turned out like this...

00:11:07.834 --> 00:11:08.960
What should I do?

00:11:09.044 --> 00:11:11.296
It's fine, don't worry about it.

00:11:13.465 --> 00:11:16.301
That face you're making
doesn't suit you at all.

00:11:18.678 --> 00:11:19.846
Here.

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:22.224
Drink this and cheer up.

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:24.434
Mr. Tomita...

00:11:25.018 --> 00:11:26.019
Here.

00:11:27.145 --> 00:11:28.730
Didn't I promise you...

00:11:29.523 --> 00:11:34.611
that I would make you a permanent employee
at the end of your current contract?

00:11:38.365 --> 00:11:39.533
Ms. Esa...

00:11:40.158 --> 00:11:41.243
No.

00:11:42.494 --> 00:11:43.537
Reina...

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.581
I'll protect you.

00:11:49.876 --> 00:11:52.462
Why don't we go for a drive
on your next day off to relax?

00:11:52.546 --> 00:11:55.799
I just got my car customized.

00:11:56.425 --> 00:11:59.261
Let's see. How about
somewhere around Hakone?

00:12:00.595 --> 00:12:02.514
Maybe stay the night?

00:12:03.849 --> 00:12:06.268
Wow! That sounds like fun.

00:12:07.144 --> 00:12:08.645
It's a secret, just between us.

00:12:10.021 --> 00:12:11.231
See you!

00:12:29.166 --> 00:12:30.167
Too easy.

00:12:41.511 --> 00:12:42.971
I finally caught you.

00:12:43.054 --> 00:12:44.431
Why are you here?

00:12:44.514 --> 00:12:47.142
You're always posting
about the happy hour here on Instagram.

00:12:48.268 --> 00:12:50.228
Ms. Kanbe and I were looking for you.

00:12:50.312 --> 00:12:52.856
We figured you'd be
drinking alone somewhere.

00:12:52.939 --> 00:12:54.024
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

00:12:54.107 --> 00:12:56.067
-Two more beers, please.
-Certainly.

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:00.030
I wanted to talk to you.

00:13:02.032 --> 00:13:06.203
You might not believe it,
but I prefer to do my brooding alone.

00:13:08.914 --> 00:13:11.500
What's going on
with the company's investigation?

00:13:12.459 --> 00:13:15.045
The higher-ups wouldn't tell us anything.

00:13:16.713 --> 00:13:19.925
I have to go with the director
to offer my formal apology.

00:13:21.134 --> 00:13:24.638
Miku, do you really think
it was your fault?

00:13:24.721 --> 00:13:27.599
Well, I definitely don't remember
being that careless, but...

00:13:28.934 --> 00:13:32.938
there were just so many guests that day,

00:13:33.647 --> 00:13:34.898
so to be honest...

00:13:36.608 --> 00:13:37.943
I can't say for sure.

00:13:38.777 --> 00:13:39.653
Here you are.

00:13:45.617 --> 00:13:47.744
I'll go apologize.

00:13:48.328 --> 00:13:50.247
If it's for the good of the company.

00:13:52.999 --> 00:13:57.045
I'm sure the company
just wants to settle this somehow...

00:13:58.046 --> 00:13:59.214
I get that.

00:13:59.923 --> 00:14:01.591
I'm an adult.

00:14:02.259 --> 00:14:05.804
That's what being a working professional
is all about... I think.

00:14:10.642 --> 00:14:11.601
Is it, though?

00:14:13.436 --> 00:14:14.271
Huh?

00:14:16.147 --> 00:14:18.108
If you know something's wrong,

00:14:18.191 --> 00:14:22.195
but to keep someone else out of trouble,
or because it's the "adult" thing to do,

00:14:22.862 --> 00:14:24.698
you just keep your mouth shut.

00:14:25.699 --> 00:14:27.659
Is that really the right thing to do?

00:14:31.454 --> 00:14:32.330
I...

00:14:33.665 --> 00:14:36.042
want to be someone
who can say whatever she wants.

00:14:38.169 --> 00:14:39.296
Someone strong...

00:14:40.714 --> 00:14:42.882
Someone like you, Miku.

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:50.724
That's not good.

00:14:51.308 --> 00:14:53.977
They just got a big contract,

00:14:54.603 --> 00:14:57.647
but they pissed off the
Asahi Department Store chairman.

00:14:57.731 --> 00:14:59.816
You think the new girl will get fired?

00:15:01.067 --> 00:15:02.569
It's inevitable.

00:15:02.652 --> 00:15:04.904
She can't do her job right.

00:15:07.032 --> 00:15:08.325
All right.

00:15:10.118 --> 00:15:11.328
Are you going home already?

00:15:11.828 --> 00:15:14.205
Well... there are some things
I have to prepare.

00:15:15.707 --> 00:15:16.958
I see.

00:15:17.709 --> 00:15:19.628
Misa is meeting your parents
this week, right?

00:15:20.795 --> 00:15:25.300
So you get what you want
and then head right back to Misa, huh?

00:15:27.052 --> 00:15:28.887
So that's how it is.

00:15:34.267 --> 00:15:35.560
I was thinking.

00:15:36.269 --> 00:15:38.730
After I get married,
let's meet like this sometimes.

00:15:40.231 --> 00:15:41.399
What do you mean?

00:15:42.484 --> 00:15:43.610
You know, like at work.

00:15:43.693 --> 00:15:45.820
You need the right person for each job.

00:15:46.446 --> 00:15:49.616
Misa is definitely the kind, modest wife.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:53.787
And you're... the cute,
sexy mistress type.

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:59.793
I know that I can keep you satisfied.

00:15:59.876 --> 00:16:02.504
So, as long as Misa doesn't find out,

00:16:02.587 --> 00:16:04.923
I think we can keep this going.

00:16:10.929 --> 00:16:12.472
I'll message you later.

00:16:27.195 --> 00:16:29.781
A faithful wife and a sexy mistress.

00:16:30.407 --> 00:16:33.868
Am I living every man's dream?

00:16:39.582 --> 00:16:42.460
Life gets busy as a stud.

00:16:43.378 --> 00:16:44.462
Yeah, hello?

00:16:44.546 --> 00:16:46.214
Tomoya, are you okay?

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:47.924
Huh?

00:16:48.633 --> 00:16:53.221
Dulcis Coin is the cryptocurrency
you invested in, right?

00:16:53.304 --> 00:16:54.472
MASSIVE CRYPTOCURRENCY FRAUD

00:16:58.810 --> 00:16:59.644
Huh?

00:17:00.895 --> 00:17:01.730
What?!

00:17:04.441 --> 00:17:05.483
No!

00:17:07.652 --> 00:17:08.778
What?!

00:17:15.952 --> 00:17:18.413
I finally got a hold of the guy
from my university

00:17:18.496 --> 00:17:20.206
who introduced me to it...

00:17:20.874 --> 00:17:24.210
But he said they got him too.

00:17:24.878 --> 00:17:26.546
How much did you invest?

00:17:26.629 --> 00:17:28.631
You said you put in more, right?

00:17:31.259 --> 00:17:34.179
-Don't hide things from me.
-Almost all of my savings,

00:17:35.138 --> 00:17:36.890
and with my parents' land as collateral,

00:17:37.474 --> 00:17:39.851
I got loans from banks
and some cash advances...

00:17:41.478 --> 00:17:42.353
Twenty million yen.

00:17:44.439 --> 00:17:45.607
And all of it's gone?

00:17:46.483 --> 00:17:48.902
I'll talk to my mom about it
when the timing is right,

00:17:49.611 --> 00:17:50.904
but... Misa, I'm sorry,

00:17:50.987 --> 00:17:53.615
I don't think I can pay
the down payment on the condo.

00:17:57.869 --> 00:18:00.079
It's fine. I'll pay for it.

00:18:01.581 --> 00:18:02.457
Huh?

00:18:03.041 --> 00:18:04.876
I paid the first time too, after all.

00:18:05.919 --> 00:18:07.462
Tomoya, it's ready.

00:18:08.296 --> 00:18:09.923
I'm so hungry.

00:18:10.507 --> 00:18:12.342
That condo is a necessity.

00:18:12.425 --> 00:18:13.510
It turned out great.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:15.261
Oh, a stew!

00:18:15.345 --> 00:18:16.596
Yeah, doesn't it look good?

00:18:16.679 --> 00:18:18.014
Thanks for the meal.

00:18:18.097 --> 00:18:19.599
Let's eat.

00:18:19.682 --> 00:18:23.895
So that Reina and Tomoya
can start their married life together.

00:18:23.978 --> 00:18:24.813
How is it?

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.190
-It's incredible.
-Really?

00:18:28.274 --> 00:18:31.486
It's our little love nest after all.
Let me pay for it.

00:18:31.569 --> 00:18:32.821
Call it a parting gift.

00:18:33.571 --> 00:18:34.405
Really?

00:18:34.489 --> 00:18:36.658
However, I have one condition.

00:18:37.325 --> 00:18:38.159
A condition?

00:18:38.743 --> 00:18:42.455
Don't tell anybody
that I'm the one who paid.

00:18:44.165 --> 00:18:44.999
Huh?

00:18:47.335 --> 00:18:50.004
I'd like to be the kind of wife
who lets her husband lead.

00:18:53.132 --> 00:18:54.676
Misa...

00:18:55.468 --> 00:18:59.013
You really are something else.

00:19:00.557 --> 00:19:03.893
Thank you, Misa.

00:19:11.568 --> 00:19:14.821
Wow, so you officially
sealed the deal the condo.

00:19:14.904 --> 00:19:18.658
Yeah, Tomoya paid
a pretty sizable down payment.

00:19:18.741 --> 00:19:22.161
He said we'd be better off financially
borrowing less for the mortgage.

00:19:22.954 --> 00:19:25.123
He's surprisingly good
at those kinds of things.

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:27.792
Where are you going to meet his parents?

00:19:27.876 --> 00:19:29.085
At Zuishotei.

00:19:29.794 --> 00:19:31.796
That's quite the splurge.

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:33.882
Tomoya made the reservation.

00:19:33.965 --> 00:19:35.592
It's a place we'll remember forever,

00:19:35.675 --> 00:19:37.552
so we wanted it to be somewhere classy.

00:19:37.635 --> 00:19:41.306
But I'm so nervous because I've never
been to such an extravagant restaurant.

00:19:42.807 --> 00:19:44.142
You seem happy.

00:19:44.642 --> 00:19:45.810
-Really?
-Yeah.

00:19:46.436 --> 00:19:50.815
It's like you trust Tomoya
without a single doubt.

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:57.030
I'm sure you'll find someone
you can trust too, Reina.

00:20:02.785 --> 00:20:04.329
Thanks for helping me choose.

00:20:04.412 --> 00:20:05.622
I'll wear this and do my best.

00:20:26.726 --> 00:20:29.103
Thank you for your patience.

00:20:29.187 --> 00:20:30.730
How would you like it cut today?

00:20:30.813 --> 00:20:32.982
Give me something intimidating.

00:20:33.608 --> 00:20:35.777
Something that would
scare people away from me.

00:20:36.903 --> 00:20:41.032
But today... weren't you supposed to meet
your fiancé's parents--

00:20:41.115 --> 00:20:42.158
His mom...

00:20:43.868 --> 00:20:45.244
isn't normal.

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:48.289
I see. I'll do my best.

00:20:53.378 --> 00:20:56.047
Leave the venue, food, and dress to me.

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:59.092
Since Misa here has no sense of style.

00:21:03.221 --> 00:21:04.138
Mother!

00:21:04.222 --> 00:21:08.726
Hello. Oh? Where's Tomo?

00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:10.603
He went out shopping for a bit.

00:21:11.229 --> 00:21:14.315
Oh, you scared me.
Didn't expect you there.

00:21:14.399 --> 00:21:15.900
Where's Tomo?

00:21:15.984 --> 00:21:19.487
What's this? Did he disappear again?

00:21:20.154 --> 00:21:20.989
Okay...

00:21:21.906 --> 00:21:24.075
Huh? Tomo?

00:21:35.586 --> 00:21:39.882
Okay, okay. Eat up, Misa.

00:21:39.966 --> 00:21:41.092
Thank you.

00:21:41.175 --> 00:21:44.137
You'll need some meat
on those bones to have healthy children.

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:45.179
Let's eat.

00:21:45.263 --> 00:21:46.222
I'm home.

00:21:46.305 --> 00:21:48.433
-Tomo, welcome home.
-Welcome back.

00:21:48.516 --> 00:21:50.309
Mom, you're here again?

00:21:50.393 --> 00:21:54.355
Today we're having
Matsuzaka beef sukiyaki.

00:21:54.439 --> 00:21:56.482
Wow, that's quality meat.

00:21:56.566 --> 00:21:58.359
-Hurry up and eat. Hot! Hot!
-Looks great.

00:21:58.443 --> 00:21:59.819
SALE
USA BEEF

00:21:59.902 --> 00:22:01.237
I'm hungry.

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:02.280
Here.

00:22:02.363 --> 00:22:03.281
This meat is so good!

00:22:03.364 --> 00:22:05.199
PRIME MATSUSAKA BEEF

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:12.331
His cousin Shin's already having
his third child.

00:22:12.415 --> 00:22:15.752
Are you getting your
regular checkups at the clinic?

00:22:22.925 --> 00:22:24.260
Mom, you look beautiful.

00:22:24.343 --> 00:22:26.554
Oh, no, I'm getting nervous!

00:22:27.221 --> 00:22:30.600
I'm sure she's a reliable person
since you chose her, Tomo.

00:22:30.683 --> 00:22:33.936
Yes. She's kind, hard-working, and frugal.

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:36.105
Then she's perfect for you, Tomo.

00:22:36.189 --> 00:22:41.360
I always dreamed of having a daughter
and going shopping with her in Ginza.

00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:44.447
I'm sure Misa would like that.

00:22:47.867 --> 00:22:49.035
She has arrived.

00:22:50.787 --> 00:22:51.954
She's here.

00:22:53.164 --> 00:22:54.207
Misa--

00:23:01.589 --> 00:23:04.717
I'm so glad to finally meet you, Mother.

00:23:06.719 --> 00:23:07.553
Huh?

00:23:09.514 --> 00:23:13.601
My name is Misa Kanbe.
I'm in a relationship with Tomoya.

00:23:13.684 --> 00:23:14.977
It's a pleasure to meet you.

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:25.905
Misa?

00:23:25.988 --> 00:23:28.074
I'm sorry to ask this,

00:23:28.157 --> 00:23:34.205
but are you prepared for marriage?

00:23:34.288 --> 00:23:36.290
What do you mean
by "prepared for marriage"?

00:23:36.374 --> 00:23:38.251
With those nails...

00:23:38.334 --> 00:23:40.086
Can you cook?

00:23:40.169 --> 00:23:42.004
What about cleaning? And laundry?

00:23:42.088 --> 00:23:44.298
Once you get married,
you can't just live your life

00:23:44.382 --> 00:23:47.009
however you want like you did
when you were single, you know?

00:23:47.093 --> 00:23:50.138
Keeping your husband healthy
is part of your duty as a wife.

00:23:50.221 --> 00:23:52.306
Just nuking frozen side dishes
in the microwave

00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:54.267
would be awful for your husband, you know?

00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:56.561
Breakfast should be freshly cooked rice,

00:23:56.644 --> 00:23:59.105
lunch, a healthy bento box,

00:23:59.188 --> 00:24:02.650
and dinner, a proper feast to fuel him
for the next day.

00:24:02.733 --> 00:24:04.610
Can you really make all of that by hand?

00:24:04.694 --> 00:24:08.197
Meat, fish, eggs, vegetables,

00:24:08.281 --> 00:24:10.783
beans, shellfish, seaweed,
mushrooms, and fruit,

00:24:10.867 --> 00:24:12.577
all should be served in balance.

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:16.414
I always serve at least five dishes,
including main and side dishes.

00:24:16.497 --> 00:24:19.625
My son grew up in such a home.

00:24:19.709 --> 00:24:22.879
It is fine if you want to work,

00:24:22.962 --> 00:24:25.548
but neglecting your household chores...

00:24:25.631 --> 00:24:28.050
Why should I work, Mother?

00:24:31.429 --> 00:24:33.014
Why?

00:24:34.932 --> 00:24:37.810
Are you saying you're going to go out
and have fun

00:24:37.894 --> 00:24:39.437
while Tomo works hard to earn money?

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:42.648
I have to serve fresh rice for breakfast,
prepare a balanced bento for lunch,

00:24:42.732 --> 00:24:45.943
and at least five dishes for dinner,
not to mention cleaning, and laundry.

00:24:46.027 --> 00:24:47.945
When do I have time for office work?

00:24:48.029 --> 00:24:52.283
You're a full-time employee
at Suzutoya, right?

00:24:52.366 --> 00:24:55.453
Are you going to quit
and live on Tomo's earnings alone?

00:24:55.536 --> 00:24:57.455
Any amount of money will never be enough.

00:24:57.538 --> 00:25:00.666
-How will you raise children?
-We won't have any, so it's fine.

00:25:05.713 --> 00:25:08.507
We come from a distinguished family.

00:25:08.591 --> 00:25:10.301
That kind of behavior
will not be tolerated!

00:25:10.384 --> 00:25:14.931
So how do you expect me to work, do the
chores, make his food, and have a child?

00:25:15.014 --> 00:25:18.601
Oh, will you be hiring
a housekeeper for us?

00:25:18.684 --> 00:25:22.188
Just how lazy are you?

00:25:22.271 --> 00:25:25.441
This is what's expected
of all women after they marry!

00:25:25.524 --> 00:25:27.818
That sounds like
something out of the stone age.

00:25:32.406 --> 00:25:35.743
What's with that tone?

00:25:36.702 --> 00:25:39.247
And that attitude?!

00:25:45.503 --> 00:25:47.380
As I thought,

00:25:48.005 --> 00:25:50.883
girls from parentless households
are just no good.

00:26:00.726 --> 00:26:01.560
Hey, old lady.

00:26:07.066 --> 00:26:07.984
Old lady?

00:26:08.901 --> 00:26:09.986
Old lady?

00:26:10.653 --> 00:26:13.406
Huh?! Are you talking about me?

00:26:13.489 --> 00:26:17.118
Yes, old lady. We're not married yet,
so not my Mother, but just some old lady.

00:26:17.201 --> 00:26:18.411
Misa, what's going on?!

00:26:18.494 --> 00:26:20.746
-What the hell are you thinking?!
-Old lady,

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:23.082
are your parents still alive?

00:26:23.874 --> 00:26:26.085
We both lost our parents, haven't we?

00:26:26.669 --> 00:26:29.630
So why bring mine into this
just to mock me?

00:26:31.424 --> 00:26:34.093
My father is no longer in this world,

00:26:35.386 --> 00:26:37.096
but if he could see me now,

00:26:38.889 --> 00:26:42.852
I know he'd be smiling...
and proud of who I am.

00:26:47.315 --> 00:26:50.151
Don't force your
ridiculous values on others...

00:26:50.609 --> 00:26:51.444
old lady.

00:27:09.503 --> 00:27:10.504
Misa...

00:27:11.922 --> 00:27:13.632
Come on, Misa!

00:27:15.301 --> 00:27:18.012
What are you thinking?
And what's with the outfit?

00:27:18.095 --> 00:27:19.555
This outfit? My gyaru look.

00:27:19.638 --> 00:27:21.432
That's not what I'm asking you.

00:27:21.515 --> 00:27:23.684
Looks great on me, right?
Even I'm surprised.

00:27:23.768 --> 00:27:26.020
Whatever, anyway, let's go back.

00:27:26.103 --> 00:27:28.564
If we go back and apologize,
it might just work...

00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:30.858
Well, it's probably impossible now,

00:27:30.941 --> 00:27:33.736
but if you apologize for real,
my mom might forgive you.

00:27:33.819 --> 00:27:35.321
Apologize? Me? Why?

00:27:35.905 --> 00:27:36.739
Huh?

00:27:37.323 --> 00:27:39.825
Are you trying to ruin our marriage?

00:27:39.909 --> 00:27:41.452
Who's the one ruining our marriage?

00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:43.913
Huh?

00:27:43.996 --> 00:27:45.039
I know.

00:27:45.122 --> 00:27:47.249
The night of the Olympic tasting event.

00:27:47.666 --> 00:27:49.835
I know what you did and who with.

00:27:53.381 --> 00:27:55.299
Could you let go of my arms?

00:27:57.885 --> 00:27:59.929
Well, that's...

00:28:01.389 --> 00:28:02.473
That's...

00:28:03.015 --> 00:28:05.142
Misa! Tomoya!

00:28:05.226 --> 00:28:07.561
I came because I was worried about Misa.

00:28:11.941 --> 00:28:14.276
What happened?
Where's the dress I chose for you?

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:15.903
It didn't suit me, so I didn't wear it.

00:28:18.781 --> 00:28:20.282
Did something happen?

00:28:21.242 --> 00:28:23.327
-Why don't the two of us talk for a bit?
-The two of us?

00:28:27.998 --> 00:28:30.084
I'll leave the rest to the two of you.

00:28:32.461 --> 00:28:33.546
Take your time.

00:28:38.092 --> 00:28:42.138
Seriously. She's unbelievable.

00:28:42.221 --> 00:28:43.431
Let's go, Tomo.

00:28:46.308 --> 00:28:48.686
Nice to meet you, Mother.

00:29:01.615 --> 00:29:02.700
Yes!

00:29:03.325 --> 00:29:04.493
Yes!

00:29:10.082 --> 00:29:13.002
We sincerely apologize
for the trouble we have caused.

00:29:13.085 --> 00:29:14.837
We are truly sorry.

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:17.798
I told you there was no need to come.

00:29:18.507 --> 00:29:20.259
-That wouldn't be right.
-You!

00:29:20.342 --> 00:29:22.011
I remember you well.

00:29:22.094 --> 00:29:26.140
You told one of your female workers
to bring the ingredients list.

00:29:26.223 --> 00:29:31.020
Yes, there were a lot of guests that day,

00:29:31.103 --> 00:29:33.856
and although
I don't exactly remember it clearly,

00:29:33.939 --> 00:29:36.817
the person in charge
of the live kitchen was...

00:29:39.487 --> 00:29:42.239
Can you bring me the list of ingredients
for the mushi manju?

00:29:42.323 --> 00:29:46.160
Yes, over there... I'll show you.
Right this way.

00:29:47.077 --> 00:29:49.246
Here is the ingredient list
for the mushi manju.

00:29:50.039 --> 00:29:51.207
That girl right there.

00:29:51.290 --> 00:29:53.125
There's no doubt in my mind, it's her.

00:29:53.209 --> 00:29:55.294
My deepest apologies.

00:29:59.131 --> 00:30:00.424
That girl right there.

00:30:01.217 --> 00:30:03.135
There's no doubt in my mind, it's her.

00:30:03.677 --> 00:30:06.055
Hey, what are you just standing there for?

00:30:06.138 --> 00:30:08.390
Don't you have something to say?

00:30:12.394 --> 00:30:15.606
-We sincerely... apologize for--
-Please wait.

00:30:17.483 --> 00:30:21.403
We took footage of that day
for future reference

00:30:22.154 --> 00:30:25.199
so we could check if something happened.

00:30:34.375 --> 00:30:36.252
Would you mind checking it with me?

00:31:04.196 --> 00:31:09.243
Was this employee the one
who gave you the wrong ingredient list?

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:12.079
Yes, it was this girl.

00:31:12.162 --> 00:31:13.497
Without a doubt.

00:31:14.456 --> 00:31:16.000
Thank you for confirming.

00:31:17.251 --> 00:31:19.962
We take this incident very seriously

00:31:20.045 --> 00:31:23.340
and the employee in question
will be held responsible

00:31:23.424 --> 00:31:25.593
to the full extent of company regulations.

00:31:25.676 --> 00:31:28.387
We will also thoroughly educate
all employees

00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:31.515
to prevent this from ever happening again.

00:31:31.599 --> 00:31:35.144
Chairman, ma'am,

00:31:35.936 --> 00:31:39.857
we are truly sorry for this incident.

00:31:40.816 --> 00:31:42.276
Our deepest apologies.

00:31:42.985 --> 00:31:43.944
That's enough.

00:31:53.162 --> 00:31:54.496
Mr. Tomita,

00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:58.292
you knew that Ms. Esaka was the one
who gave them the wrong ingredient list

00:31:59.001 --> 00:32:01.128
and you framed someone else,
isn't that right?

00:32:01.211 --> 00:32:03.047
No, no, not at all.

00:32:03.130 --> 00:32:07.635
That day, I was also very busy
and my memory is a bit jumbled.

00:32:07.718 --> 00:32:10.638
You two must have been
the culprits the first time too.

00:32:11.221 --> 00:32:12.056
Huh?

00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:17.394
It would be best if you left headquarters
until things calm down.

00:32:17.478 --> 00:32:20.689
I never did such careless work.

00:32:21.398 --> 00:32:23.776
Not even my own brother believes me?

00:32:25.986 --> 00:32:27.488
The first time?

00:32:27.571 --> 00:32:28.530
No...

00:32:29.156 --> 00:32:30.658
I'm just contemplating...

00:32:31.408 --> 00:32:33.535
the fact that I couldn't
trust my little sister.

00:32:33.619 --> 00:32:34.578
Little sister?

00:32:37.039 --> 00:32:38.707
Oh, didn't I tell you?

00:32:53.889 --> 00:32:55.057
Good work today.

00:33:02.189 --> 00:33:03.232
Yay!

00:33:15.494 --> 00:33:18.455
To think you went to meet
his parents in that outfit.

00:33:19.081 --> 00:33:21.041
I said things I've wanted to say
for a long time.

00:33:22.084 --> 00:33:23.335
Did I freak you out?

00:33:25.337 --> 00:33:30.092
I prefer the angry you...
to the one that wears a false smile.

00:33:35.431 --> 00:33:40.936
So your goal
was to foist Hirano onto Esaka.

00:33:45.858 --> 00:33:48.026
Do you think it's in bad taste?

00:33:50.028 --> 00:33:55.325
If you're going to such lengths,
I'm sure you have your reasons.

00:33:57.077 --> 00:33:59.913
Why do you believe in me so much?

00:34:00.497 --> 00:34:02.291
I just have an eye for people.

00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:05.252
I could be just another bad girl.

00:34:06.086 --> 00:34:07.755
Then I guess you've got me fooled.

00:34:22.102 --> 00:34:24.271
I'm glad you were able
to clear Miku's name.

00:34:24.897 --> 00:34:27.566
But I still can't forgive Reina and Tomita
for what they did.

00:34:28.609 --> 00:34:30.444
I still have something to do...

00:34:32.237 --> 00:34:33.697
regarding that incident.

00:34:34.656 --> 00:34:35.491
Huh?

00:34:48.212 --> 00:34:49.171
Misa.

00:34:50.506 --> 00:34:51.632
Misa.

00:34:52.925 --> 00:34:54.218
Hey, Misa.

00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:56.929
I just want to clear up
any misunderstandings.

00:34:57.012 --> 00:34:58.639
It wasn't serious.

00:34:58.722 --> 00:35:01.225
It was one time. Just one time.

00:35:01.308 --> 00:35:04.895
Plus, I was drunk, and Reina seduced me.

00:35:04.978 --> 00:35:06.980
She tempted me with her feminine wiles.

00:35:07.731 --> 00:35:09.983
Come on, Misa, just listen.

00:35:13.695 --> 00:35:14.905
You're so heartless.

00:35:15.656 --> 00:35:16.490
Huh?

00:35:17.032 --> 00:35:19.493
Of all people, you chose my best friend?

00:35:19.576 --> 00:35:21.411
How could you betray me like that?

00:35:21.495 --> 00:35:24.540
-Hey, Misa, keep your voice down--
-We were engaged!

00:35:24.623 --> 00:35:27.292
And yet you had an affair
with my best friend, Reina!

00:35:27.376 --> 00:35:30.963
-Hey, come on, Misa, just calm down--
-I trusted you!

00:35:32.172 --> 00:35:33.298
You're terrible!

00:35:34.132 --> 00:35:35.717
You're so heartless!

00:35:35.801 --> 00:35:37.511
Misa, please calm down.

00:35:38.595 --> 00:35:41.390
Let's take some time to talk, Misa.
I'm sorry.

00:35:42.808 --> 00:35:45.978
-Misa, just try to get up.
-Let go!

00:35:47.938 --> 00:35:48.856
Did you hear?

00:35:48.939 --> 00:35:49.815
I heard, I heard.

00:35:50.274 --> 00:35:51.400
-Good afternoon.
-Afternoon.

00:35:51.483 --> 00:35:52.901
Hey, did you see that?

00:35:52.985 --> 00:35:54.403
-Whoa!
-Did you guys see this?

00:35:54.486 --> 00:35:55.863
What is this?

00:35:57.990 --> 00:36:01.201
-Hirano in Sales is a total idiot.
-Yeah, seriously.

00:36:03.954 --> 00:36:06.290
This, this, this! Unbelievable, isn't it?

00:36:33.775 --> 00:36:36.778
Ms. Esaka, do you have a few minutes?

00:36:40.699 --> 00:36:41.825
Okay.

00:36:47.789 --> 00:36:48.665
Come in.

00:36:55.589 --> 00:36:57.424
I'm Arimoto from human resources.

00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:59.676
Please have a seat.

00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:19.613
I spoke with Section Chief Tomita
in detail

00:37:19.696 --> 00:37:22.741
about the peanut allergy incident
the other day.

00:37:24.117 --> 00:37:25.535
According to him,

00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:30.707
he knew that it was you, Ms. Esaka,
who handed over the wrong ingredient list.

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:35.045
But he couldn't bring himself to speak up
because you tearfully begged him

00:37:35.128 --> 00:37:37.130
to blame it on Ms. Miku Suzuki.

00:37:40.133 --> 00:37:43.387
It seems that Section Chief Tomita
is genuinely remorseful,

00:37:44.513 --> 00:37:46.098
but how about you, Ms. Esaka?

00:37:49.351 --> 00:37:50.936
That's not true.

00:37:51.812 --> 00:37:53.313
It's a misunderstanding.

00:37:53.397 --> 00:37:55.148
I didn't do anything like that.

00:37:55.816 --> 00:38:00.278
Miku is deceiving the Section Chief.
It wasn't me.

00:38:00.362 --> 00:38:02.739
Mr. Tomita, why would you lie about that?

00:38:02.823 --> 00:38:03.907
Please tell the truth!

00:38:05.993 --> 00:38:10.706
There are rumors going around the office
about your bad behavior.

00:38:11.999 --> 00:38:15.669
Honestly, I'm disappointed in you.

00:38:18.046 --> 00:38:19.339
Ms. Reina Esaka,

00:38:20.257 --> 00:38:23.093
the company takes this incident
very seriously

00:38:23.176 --> 00:38:26.263
and will be terminating your contract
at the end of this term.

00:38:26.346 --> 00:38:27.347
Huh?

00:38:27.431 --> 00:38:29.975
We will pay your salary
during the contractual period,

00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:32.602
so please stay at home until December.

00:38:34.021 --> 00:38:35.147
What do you mean?

00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:37.441
You no longer need to come into work.

00:38:39.276 --> 00:38:40.861
Does this mean...

00:38:41.945 --> 00:38:44.448
I'm being fired?

00:38:46.074 --> 00:38:48.785
I would say this is more than fair.

00:39:07.846 --> 00:39:08.764
Misa!

00:39:10.182 --> 00:39:12.642
Please explain what happened
to human resources.

00:39:12.726 --> 00:39:16.646
No one believes me
because of Section Chief Tomita.

00:39:16.730 --> 00:39:20.150
If it's coming from you,
everyone will listen, right?

00:39:20.233 --> 00:39:21.234
Please.

00:39:22.277 --> 00:39:24.071
I always trusted you...

00:39:24.905 --> 00:39:26.239
Reina.

00:39:33.163 --> 00:39:35.707
Until you started sleeping
with my husband.

00:39:41.296 --> 00:39:44.883
I decided to start over with Tomoya.

00:39:46.301 --> 00:39:47.719
He told me...

00:39:48.512 --> 00:39:51.765
that what happened with you was a mistake.

00:39:51.848 --> 00:39:53.266
It was just a fling.

00:39:55.811 --> 00:39:58.647
So I guess you were
just being toyed with, huh?

00:39:58.730 --> 00:39:59.564
I'm sorry,

00:40:00.273 --> 00:40:02.734
but please forgive Tomoya.

00:40:03.443 --> 00:40:06.488
I think I'm going to forgive him too.

00:40:06.988 --> 00:40:12.244
Because our relationship cannot be broken
over something this petty.

00:40:14.621 --> 00:40:17.040
I'll even forgive you too.

00:40:19.668 --> 00:40:24.089
Because you have no friends, no job,

00:40:24.172 --> 00:40:26.258
and nobody would choose you.

00:40:27.551 --> 00:40:32.139
That's just beyond sad and pathetic.

00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:40.856
Reina.

00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:46.778
I'll invite you to the wedding, okay?

00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:16.183
TOMOYA HIRANO

00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:23.023
Morning! Can we talk today?
Are you gonna ignore me forever?

00:41:23.106 --> 00:41:24.649
Text me back
Come on, please...

00:41:24.733 --> 00:41:25.734
I wanna see you

00:41:25.817 --> 00:41:29.863
If you keep ignoring me,
I'm going to start getting ideas

00:41:29.946 --> 00:41:35.202
Sorry! I had to work today.
I'll text you later!

00:41:35.285 --> 00:41:40.165
I'm sorry. Take your time.

00:41:40.248 --> 00:41:41.791
SORRY

00:41:41.875 --> 00:41:44.461
MISA_0816 UPLOADED A NEW PHOTO

00:41:44.544 --> 00:41:47.380
THANK YOU AS ALWAYS
#DATE #MEMORIES

00:42:29.673 --> 00:42:30.757
Hello.

00:42:31.591 --> 00:42:34.594
This is Reina Esaka
from Suzutoya Holdings.

00:42:34.678 --> 00:42:37.180
We met the other day.

00:42:40.934 --> 00:42:41.935
Yes.

00:42:42.727 --> 00:42:44.521
It's been a while.

00:42:45.981 --> 00:42:47.524
How are you?

00:42:50.735 --> 00:42:55.532
Actually, I have something
I want to discuss with you.

00:42:56.449 --> 00:42:59.119
Can't you at least give me
some of my money back?

00:42:59.202 --> 00:43:02.872
You told me it was a sure thing.
I even borrowed money from a loan shark.

00:43:03.748 --> 00:43:06.626
So how am I supposed
to pay the money back?!

00:43:08.295 --> 00:43:09.462
Hello?

00:43:11.798 --> 00:43:12.924
Shit!

00:43:14.092 --> 00:43:17.846
You stupid shithead amateur! Stop giving
investing advice you can't back up!

00:43:23.059 --> 00:43:24.102
Hello?

00:43:24.769 --> 00:43:28.815
So, no matter what Mom says,
I'm going to marry Misa--

00:43:30.817 --> 00:43:31.651
Huh?

00:43:33.278 --> 00:43:37.240
After many rounds of improvements,
we're finally ready for the unveiling.

00:43:37.324 --> 00:43:41.453
Shine Muscat Daifuku will be on sale
at Suzutoya from next year.

00:43:42.162 --> 00:43:45.123
Please, go ahead.
Yes, please help yourself.

00:43:47.083 --> 00:43:49.878
Please, go ahead. Please.

00:43:50.545 --> 00:43:51.421
She seems excited.

00:43:52.005 --> 00:43:54.257
That's because she
just became section chief.

00:43:54.341 --> 00:43:55.383
I see.

00:43:56.301 --> 00:43:57.135
Yes.

00:43:59.262 --> 00:44:00.263
That's right. Yes.

00:44:01.222 --> 00:44:04.184
As long as there's a substitute,
I can change my fate.

00:44:05.143 --> 00:44:06.061
Thank you very much.

00:44:06.144 --> 00:44:11.066
Instead of Ms. Sumiyoshi quitting
due to power harassment, Reina resigned.

00:44:11.149 --> 00:44:14.361
And instead of Miku taking the blame
for the peanut allergy incident,

00:44:14.444 --> 00:44:16.196
Tomita was sent to the subsidiary.

00:44:28.375 --> 00:44:32.796
And this man who shouldn't know anything
managed to make all of it possible.

00:44:35.673 --> 00:44:37.342
Please take a seat over here.

00:44:37.425 --> 00:44:38.843
No, I'll help.

00:44:39.761 --> 00:44:41.930
Then, would you mind
taking over the drinks?

00:44:56.778 --> 00:44:57.946
PRIVATE EVENT

00:44:59.197 --> 00:45:00.281
Welcome...

00:45:00.365 --> 00:45:01.574
Oh, hello.

00:45:04.285 --> 00:45:06.287
-It's been a while, everyone.
-Come on...

00:45:06.371 --> 00:45:08.873
-Congratulations.
-I'm glad there are some open seats.

00:45:08.957 --> 00:45:12.001
Reina, let's sit over here. Here.

00:45:15.296 --> 00:45:17.882
Sorry for intruding all of a sudden.

00:45:17.966 --> 00:45:19.759
But it's okay, right?

00:45:19.843 --> 00:45:23.596
Since we've all
worked together for so long.

00:45:25.306 --> 00:45:26.558
What are you doing?

00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:31.688
-You haven't heard yet?
-Heard what?

00:45:35.608 --> 00:45:40.447
You couldn't tell her, huh?
You're too nice, Tomoya.

00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:45.034
What do you mean?

00:45:50.665 --> 00:45:52.125
Right here, in my stomach...

00:45:53.585 --> 00:45:55.128
I have a baby.

00:46:07.932 --> 00:46:10.351
Yesterday, I went to Tomoya's house...

00:46:11.519 --> 00:46:15.607
and talked with him and his parents.

00:46:17.025 --> 00:46:21.988
Everyone agreed
that we want to protect this new life.

00:46:31.331 --> 00:46:32.916
Sorry, Misa.

00:46:33.708 --> 00:46:36.085
I don't expect you to forgive me.

00:46:37.086 --> 00:46:41.090
But... I am truly sorry...

00:46:42.383 --> 00:46:44.052
that this happened...

00:46:45.929 --> 00:46:47.555
and that I hurt you.

00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:55.313
I...

00:46:57.023 --> 00:46:59.651
Tomoya and I are getting married.

00:46:59.734 --> 00:47:02.820
-Getting married?
-What's going on?

00:47:02.904 --> 00:47:04.447
Oh my god...

00:47:05.114 --> 00:47:07.867
-That's terrible...
-Seriously?

00:47:08.368 --> 00:47:09.410
What?

00:47:15.583 --> 00:47:16.626
I won.

00:48:09.721 --> 00:48:10.722
I won!
