00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.499
Hiroko-san, I want to have a
deeper relationship with you.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:08.300
Even though I didn't remember, once things get out
of control, I have no idea what might happen next.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.199
I've never done it!!

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.200
You haven't done it?!

00:00:11.201 --> 00:00:13.589
Great! She didn't get hurt!

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.579
What do you mean by "that's great"?!

00:00:15.604 --> 00:00:18.024
My first time.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.840
When is it finally going to happen?!

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.900
The result...

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.200
nothing happened all the way until morning.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.600
So that's it, nothing
happened! That's a relief!

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.300
That line.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.400
What does that even mean?

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.000
It really suits you.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.600
Thank you.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.300
You've always admired wedding
dresses, even since way back, haven't you?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Yeah.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.900
Because it's only at that moment during the
wedding that I get to be the main character.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Huh?

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.500
Someone as ordinary as me only gets
noticed by everyone at times like this.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.199
What are you talking about!

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.700
- That's not true at all.
- It is!

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.890
Ah! But Hiro-chan, you used to really dream
of wearing a wedding dress too, didn't you?

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.099
Huh, is that so?

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.803
See, we're supposed to be
drawing wedding ceremonies,

00:01:21.828 --> 00:01:26.866
but Hiro-chan, you always end
up drawing a bunch of brides.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.700
You really used to dream of
becoming a bride, didn't you?

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.376
From that moment on, I was
absolutely sure I'm totally into girls!

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.400
You've always been really
passionate about the things you love.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.100
That's exactly the
kind of Hiro-chan I love.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.529
Like that?

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:45.530
Hmm...

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.479
Someone who doesn't just go with the flow.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.490
Like saying you don't even need a groom at a wedding,

00:01:51.694 --> 00:01:53.983
or drawing all sorts of
weird and quirky houses.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.999
Saying things like, "One day,
I'm going to build a house like this."

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.200
- Hahaha... Is that so?
- Yeah...

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.800
Back then, I always
thought you were really cool.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.500
Yeah.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.500
Back then, I could think about
those things so naturally...

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.200
So beautiful.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.940
Hiro-chan! Let's go!

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.509
Where are we going?

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.329
Catch the bouquet! Let's go!

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.199
I'm not going! Tsumugi, you go instead.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.680
- It's fine, it's fine, let's go, hurry up.
- Tsumugi, wait up.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.600
Wait!

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.700
Here it comes!

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Over here, over here! Throw it this way!

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.700
Here!

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.400
Congratulations!

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.599
Congratulations, Hiro-chan!

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.200
- Is Hiroko the next one to get married?
- That's right.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.020
- Sorry...
- Hiro-chan, are you getting married?

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.400
Marriage?

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.000
Getting married, huh...

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.600
I'm not sure.

00:03:32.676 --> 00:03:33.735
Not getting married?

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.800
Why?

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.270
Huh?

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.000
Why is that...

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.500
(The goddess of Hawaii)

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.400
Oh... goddess.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.900
The goddess for me is...

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.999
Come here...

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.700
Ayaka...

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.780
Oh, come on.

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.300
What's wrong?

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.276
Because you kept staring at me...

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.099
Ah! Um... I was just daydreaming.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.990
Fantasizing?

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.000
It's nothing, really. I just think the stories
about Hawaiian goddesses are really fascinating.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.600
Ayaka, do you like Hawaii too?

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.629
I absolutely love it too. I go to Hawaii every year!

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.300
Oh! Is that so?

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:11.060
It also says here that there are a lot
of goddesses in Hawaiian mythology.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.269
I think that's how it is!

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.599
For example,

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:19.800
in Hawaii, they say that what you see on the
moon isn't a rabbit, but the goddess Hina!

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.500
- There's a goddess living on the moon.
- That's right!

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.800
Everyone believes that deities
reside within the things of nature.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
That's why people even go to
the beach to bathe in the moonlight!

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.900
Huh! I've never really paid
attention to the moon before.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.400
Everyone says the moon
holds a special power!

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.500
Oh! By the way, tonight's a full moon.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.699
This is really lucky!

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.000
Huh, why?

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.217
Doesn't everyone say that during a full moon,
your inner strength and potential get awakened,

00:05:51.288 --> 00:05:53.498
and your luck gets a boost too?

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.500
Today's event is sure to be a huge success.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.500
Inner strength!

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.500
Luck is on the rise!

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.600
Good luck...

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:16.200
Ayaka...

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.900
In other words, we absolutely
have to take the initiative today.

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.700
Um... Ayaka, are you okay?

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.400
No problem!!

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.650
Give it your all at work!

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:32.850
Alright.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.500
Watch me, Moon Goddess.

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.000
"AYAKA is in LOVE with HIROKO 2nd Stage"

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.200
(Episode 3: Life is Beautiful!)

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.800
Always watching over me with such kindness.

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.100
Dad.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:31.900
Mom.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.000
Thank you all so much.

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.500
And... my favorite, Hiro-chan.

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:43.999
Hiro-chan has always been there for me.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.700
That kind of courage to
honestly speak your mind.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:52.500
Even though we sometimes argue,

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.800
But no matter what, you're
always honest and sincere.

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:00.500
A Hiro-chan like that.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.000
You're the one I look up to!

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.700
Thank you so much!

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.300
Sorry, Keiko!

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.600
I'm really not that amazing, you know.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:27.300
Honestly, back then, it felt like anyone
would do as long as they had a chest.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.400
Everything changed after I met Ayaka.

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:02.600
Hiroko-san.

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:07.500
Aloha... My love... This is for youâ™¡

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:11.190
This time...

00:09:11.191 --> 00:09:14.400
My aloha is about to get all aloha too!

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.280
No, no way.

00:09:16.281 --> 00:09:18.999
I've decided I won't look
at Ayaka that way anymore.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.339
I need to be more serious
and cherish her even more.

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:23.900
Vanish, worries! Be gone, desires!

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:45.000
My father-in-law and mother-in-law
have a really good relationship!

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:47.180
Because I like her the most.

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:49.976
When she goes out, I make sure
she carries pepper spray for protection.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.920
I even secretly followed her to her lunch date
with her mom friends, and ended up getting scolded!

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.300
He was interfering in my life too much, I just
couldn't take it anymore and ran away from home.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.640
This is a misunderstanding that
only happens because of love.

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:05.900
Love...

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:07.500
That's way too much...

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:13.480
Oh, right!

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.830
Hiroko-san, I'll be
having dinner out tonight.

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:19.599
- Who are you having dinner with?
- Risa.

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:20.380
Where?

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:21.200
At her place.

00:10:21.201 --> 00:10:22.759
Then remember to let me
know when you're done.

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:25.099
- I can pick you up at the station.
- No need!

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:27.600
If you're going to be home
late, make sure to let me know.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:32.200
Hiroko-san, you really worry too much!

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:33.900
I'm heading out.

00:10:33.901 --> 00:10:35.000
Stay safe on your way.

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:38.499
Be careful, okay?

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:39.100
Okay.

00:10:39.101 --> 00:10:40.499
Make sure to contact me!

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:42.300
I'm already doing it!

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:46.000
I almost asked her if she
wanted to put a GPS on herself.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.500
Hiroko's personality is a lot like mine. If we're
not careful, you might end up being disliked...

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:54.500
I'm totally fine!

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:59.600
This kind of bloodline... that's not good!

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:01.900
Alright, thank you.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.639
It's finally over!

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:10.000
Yeah! The reason this event turned out so
great this time is all thanks to everyone.

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.400
- Really appreciate it.
- Thank you so much.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.859
- Then let's wrap things up here.
- You did a great job.

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:16.900
Great job, everyone.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.200
Senior Ayaka.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.600
What time are you planning
to take the train back?

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:26.800
Sorry.

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:29.810
Are there any rooms available today?

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:31.600
Alright, let me check that for you.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:32.850
Huh?

00:11:32.851 --> 00:11:34.600
Ayaka, aren't you heading home?

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:38.050
I... still have things to do!

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:39.499
Is it something work-related?

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:40.699
Let me help out, too.

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:41.899
It's okay.

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:44.300
This is my own problem.

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:49.130
Miss, we have rooms available.

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:51.000
And also...

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:58.900
The deluxe suite is also
available. Would you like to book it?

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:01.500
This has happened before!

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
I want the special deluxe suite!!

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.100
Understood.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:12.700
Full moon...

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:15.000
Grant me strength!

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:19.700
For you.

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:20.700
Hm?

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.929
Thank you so much for today.

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:28.869
This is just a little something from me, and, when
I was looking through photo albums back home...

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:30.499
I also put in the drawing
we talked about earlier!

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:33.240
Oh, come on, thank you!

00:12:33.265 --> 00:12:34.999
No problem. You're heading
back to Tokyo tomorrow, right?

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.400
Yeah, what about you and Keiko?

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.419
We're heading to Daisuke's
hometown tomorrow.

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:42.999
We're heading to Singapore for a trip next!

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.430
Oh! A honeymoon trip?

00:12:45.455 --> 00:12:45.825
Yeah.

00:12:46.001 --> 00:12:49.540
When we got married, it just wasn't
the right time for us to travel abroad.

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.800
We're planning to make
up for that lost time now.

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:54.699
Tsumugi!

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:56.540
This is your very first
time traveling abroad!

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:58.399
I'm really looking forward to
the souvenirs you'll bring back.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:12:59.300
Got it.

00:12:59.301 --> 00:13:03.100
I'll bring the souvenirs straight to
Hiro-chan's place for you as soon as I get them!

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:04.500
Huh?

00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:07.300
Because I want to
give it to you right away!

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.200
Can I go to Hiro-chan's place?

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:14.100
Thank you.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.320
I'm really looking forward to it!

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:25.700
A lot happened, but I'm really glad
everything turned out okay in the end.

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.400
Even if we can't get married...

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.200
As long as I can always be with Ayaka.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Just this is enough.

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:43.599
Hiroko's personality is a lot like mine. If we're
not careful, you might end up being disliked...

00:13:43.624 --> 00:13:46.024
You might end up being disliked...

00:13:51.118 --> 00:13:52.100
Hm?

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:08.600
Goddess of the Moon, Hina...

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:14.199
Hina's husband is rough and selfish.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:17.400
Completely disregarding Hina's feelings.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.400
I can't stand living like this anymore.

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:23.660
I want to go somewhere far away by myself.

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:31.300
So Hina walked along the rainbow in the night sky, leaving
her husband behind and heading to the moon all by herself.

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.600
This can't go on!

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:41.300
I need to hold myself back a bit more,
so Ayaka won't end up disliking me.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.700
- Hello, Ayaka?
- Hi, Hiroko-san!

00:14:52.776 --> 00:14:55.775
I've decided to stay one more night.

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:56.800
Ah! Really?

00:14:56.801 --> 00:14:58.500
Did something go wrong?

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:05.300
No, it's nothing! Work's already wrapped up smoothly.
I just thought I'd go back with Hiroko-san tomorrow.

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:07.500
- Yeah.
- So...

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:10.400
Do you want to come to my room?

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:12.600
Got it, I'll be right there.

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:29.200
What's this?

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.800
Wh-why are we in such a luxurious place?

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:00.400
Putting on a samurai-like expression...

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:03.600
Hiroko-san.

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.600
I want to have an honest talk with you.

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:12.000
Honestly... talk things out?

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.800
I have something I want
to ask you, Hiroko-san.

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.099
Are you listening, Hiroko-san?

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:30.460
I'm listening!

00:16:30.461 --> 00:16:31.500
Are you really?

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.340
No way!

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:38.500
I just made up my mind to restrain
myself so I won't end up being disliked!

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:41.800
How can you get so excited
over something so simple!

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:45.300
Yesterday...

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:51.800
Hearing it was just an attempt... Hiroko-san,
didn't you say that was a good thing?

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:53.800
Yes...

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:56.100
What was so great about it?

00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:58.799
Th... That's...

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.520
That really shocked me, you know?

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:02.720
Yes.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.600
So that Ayaka won't hate me.

00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:08.400
I absolutely have to stop
myself from making a move!

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:12.400
Does Hiroko-san
still not like it after all?

00:17:13.673 --> 00:17:17.867
Don't people say that when there's a full moon,
your inner strength and potential get awakened,

00:17:17.892 --> 00:17:19.900
and your luck gets a boost too?

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:24.280
No, I really have to make up my mind today.

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:26.700
To become a real couple.

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:33.600
Please grant me strength,
oh Goddess of the Moon!

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:39.200
If you have any thoughts,
please let me know!

00:17:40.804 --> 00:17:42.804
Ah, so cute!

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:47.400
No, no! If I touch it now, it'll end up
just like the story of the Moon Goddess!

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:53.200
Oh, right, I've got some
of CoCo's cookies here!

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:54.460
- Go ahead, eat up!
- Cookies?

00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:57.599
More than anything, I just
wish you'd come over to my side.

00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.899
You look like you're a little cold.

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:02.199
There's a blanket here, do you want to put it on?

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.160
Come on!

00:18:03.161 --> 00:18:05.509
Wow, I'm not cold at all!

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:08.080
- Come over here instead.
- You look really tired!

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:11.876
- Want to do some stretches? One, two, three, four.
- Even though you're stretching out a lotâ€¦

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:14.900
- Two, two, three, four.
- But I'm not here to do stretches!

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:44.700
This isn't going to work.

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:46.700
If that's the case!

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:53.700
Wow! I can't believe
there's a move like that!

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:55.800
Please don't run away.

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:00.800
I want to be with Hiroko-san

00:19:01.808 --> 00:19:04.008
to become a real couple!

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:07.400
For real...

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:32.000
My determination.

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:34.700
Did it get through?

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:21.800
Hiroko-san.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000
Hiroko-san... I...

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:34.000
I'm so happy.

00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:03.500
Good morning, world!

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:09.000
This is already a timeline where
we've been through this before!

00:21:09.492 --> 00:21:11.782
Life is beautiful!

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:14.500
Aloha... My love... is all for youâ™¡

00:21:14.966 --> 00:21:18.555
Now, my relationship with
Hiroko-san is bound to change!

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:21.100
Good morning, Hiroko-san.

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:28.700
Hiroko-san?

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.800
I'm going to take a shower.

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:16.199
Finally home.

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:17.200
Yeah.

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:18.599
You can take a shower now.

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:20.500
Hiroko-san, please go in first.

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:21.950
It's okay.

00:22:21.951 --> 00:22:23.200
Ayaka, you go first.

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:26.600
Wait... are we supposed to shower together?

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.080
No need.

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:31.000
Ayaka, you go ahead.

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.100
I'm going to pack my things.

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:32.479
(Next Episode)
Hiroko-san, take care on your way.

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:33.400
Why?

00:23:33.401 --> 00:23:37.959
Once it's over, won't we
become a real couple?

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:40.909
Could this be what they
call the relationship slump?

00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:44.860
- A rough patch?
- Hiroko actually cares a lot about Ayaka!

00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:48.300
- What does it really mean to be a true couple?
- Jun!

00:23:48.476 --> 00:23:49.985
Never look directly into Jun's eyes!

00:23:50.010 --> 00:23:51.900
Ah! It's already too late...

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.800
I have absolutely no idea
what Hiroko-san is thinking.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.500
If you want to be together,
you have to endure.
