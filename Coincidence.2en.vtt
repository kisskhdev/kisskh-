00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.040
(This drama is based on
a true story.)

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:02.040
(The plot was adjusted
for entertainment purposes only.)

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.040
(We have no intention
to offend any careers,)

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.040
(encourage immoral sexual values,)

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.040
(or create a pessimistic disposition
of a gender or a group of people.)

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.840
(We would like to apologize in
advance for any misunderstandings.)

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.480
(Presents)

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.960
(Theory of Love)

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.960
Do you believe in true love?

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.840
Like soulmates?

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.400
I do.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:32.960
I thought you said
you were at the hospital.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.320
Who's this?

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.360
I asked for a divorce,
but she wouldn’t agree.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.680
So I had to sue for divorce.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.480
The case is still ongoing.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.800
Do you like it? It’s my land.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.560
Just give me a few years.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.320
I'll build a cafe
just the way you want.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.080
Let’s just do it.
I have some money saved up.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.680
- Look at this.
- I'm not a scammer.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.720
You’re not a scammer.
I'm not either.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Then who is?

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.480
Hello, Aoy and Chod.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.120
I'm Phare, 35 years old.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.000
I have a degree
in computer engineering.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.280
After graduation, I worked
at the country’s top IT firm.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.800
It's widely recognized.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.200
Within a few years,
I was promoted to supervisor.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.920
I thought that was the best thing
I gained from this firm.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.720
But there was something even better.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.240
I met a great guy,

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.320
and we got married.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.240
I got pregnant not long after.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.200
We discussed at length whether
I should quit and raise our kid.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.280
At first, I regretted letting go
of such a promising career.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.400
But over the past
seven to eight years,

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.920
raising my daughter
and watching her grow

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.080
made me realize that being a mother
is a meaningful job too.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.440
Then something unexpected happened.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.480
My husband passed away
in a car accident.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.080
I feel bad using the word "lucky,"

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.440
but he had a life insurance policy
worth millions of baht.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.640
Still, I knew I needed a job.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.440
There was my daughter’s
tuition fees and university.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.240
The mortgage payments.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.760
The money would run out
in a few years.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:55.800
Hello?

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:58.920
Yes.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.480
I'm glad you called me.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.480
Everyone at the firm misses you.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.520
But don’t you think
it’s a little too soon?

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.160
I’m so ready to get back to work.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.960
Right now,
all our positions are filled.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.480
If a new department opens up
and needs someone with your skills,

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.720
I’ll be sure to contact you.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.160
I think you should take
some time to rest.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.040
- But I...
- Take good care of yourself.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.600
I then realized that to society,

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.280
when a woman becomes a mother,

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.880
it's hard for her to be seen
as anything else.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.680
Resigning to become
a stay-at-home mom

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.800
made people assume that my knowledge
and skills were gone.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.320
Mom, the eggs are burning.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.520
Preem, step aside. Come on.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.880
I’ll make new ones for you.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.920
We’re out of eggs.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.000
I’ll go get some.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.920
Will you get to school on time?

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.680
Oh no.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.160
Mom, I can have cereal and a banana.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.320
Do you want some?
I’ll make it for you.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.400
I’m glad my daughter is so sweet.

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.000
Sometimes, instead of me
taking care of her,

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.160
she’s the one
taking care of me.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Is it good?

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:18.760
Very good.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.440
She gives me the energy
to keep fighting.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.920
But I still have to handle
life problems on my own.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.240
I'm done.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.080
You're done? Let's go.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.200
Patient VN769, please get
your medicine at counter four.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.160
I had severe migraines back then.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.080
I couldn’t eat or sleep.

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.320
The first time I saw a doctor,
it didn’t get better.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.240
I had to see the doctor many times.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.320
I thought
my doctor wasn’t competent.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.680
Then I accidentally met another one.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.240
May I sit with you?

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:54.320
- Sure.
- Thank you.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.160
People with migraines
should eat regularly.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:10.520
If you're hungry,

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.600
it increases your chance of getting
a migraine by 40 to 70 percent.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.560
Okay.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.000
I don’t mean to butt in,

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.680
but I must warn you

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.280
that sugary beverages
are high in calories.

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:38.600
If you really need the sugar,
just have half a glass.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:41.800
Follow it with some water.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.000
It’s better for your migraines.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:51.280
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:58.960
Don’t mind me.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:03.760
I still see this
as part of the hospital.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:08.840
Giving health advice
is part of my job after all.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:13.960
Okay.

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:23.680
Do you give advice to every patient?

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:27.440
Actually, no.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.280
You’re the first person, ma’am.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.720
May I call you that?

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:37.840
My name is Ake.

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.200
I’m a surgeon here.

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.720
Just a brief conversation with him

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:48.040
felt better than
months of medication.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:53.240
I asked myself why
I didn't meet this doctor sooner.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.960
It's just for one hour.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.960
- What do you think?
- Why just one hour?

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.480
- Look who's here.
- Hey.

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.240
- Ake.
- Hello.

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:15.080
- Hello.
- You're so heavy.

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.480
We started dating.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.080
Even though he was
five years younger,

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.080
he was incredibly mature.

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:23.560
He got along well with my daughter,

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:26.440
taking on the role of both father
and husband perfectly.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.680
In many ways,
Ake reminded me of my late husband.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:34.000
It felt like he had never left.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.480
Only his face
was slightly different.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.960
Your sunny-side-up egg,

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.880
shaped like a heart.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.320
He could only spend time
with me three days a week,

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.720
because the other four days
he worked in Chonburi

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.720
or at other hospitals
that needed him.

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:58.280
So we had to make the most
of those three days together.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:10.760
- What do you want to do today?
- On the days he wasn’t here,

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.040
I became a single mother again.

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.520
But I felt comforted

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:18.400
knowing we'd be a family again
in just a few days.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.440
- Other food is fine too.
- What should we eat?

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:21.440
Mom.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:22.720
It's that place.

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:26.280
Should we get Ake’s favorite cookies
for him tomorrow?

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.600
Okay.

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:30.520
Let's go.

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:41.960
- Preem.
- Yes?

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.160
Sit and wait for me here.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.480
- I'll get the cookies.
- Okay.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:51.440
Anywhere else you want to go?

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.200
Well...

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:55.560
- A cafe?
- Sure.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:57.120
Just pick them.

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:59.640
- Sure.
- We could visit a hundred cafes.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.080
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.640
Do you want to go camping
in the mountains?

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.160
Sounds good.

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:15.000
- Camping then?
- Sure.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.080
Maybe just for one night?

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:20.000
There’s a discount for two people.

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.400
You can take it.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Sorry.

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:33.000
I told them I’m off today,

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.120
but they keep calling.

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:35.560
I’ll take the call.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:46.280
Hello? What is it?

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:48.040
I’m about to head
into the operating room.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.920
- The operating room?
- Yes.

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:53.360
Where?

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.760
At the hospital, of course.

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:59.040
I’m in Chonburi today.
Did you forget?

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.080
I’ll see you tomorrow.

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.200
I have to go.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.760
The nurse is calling me. All right?

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.360
It’s nothing.

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.760
Just the usual.

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.720
This one’s cheaper than the other.

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.880
- A couple’s package.
- Yes.

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:32.480
Romantic duo.

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:33.800
- It's really cheap.
- Yes.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:34.880
What a great discount.

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:36.840
Two thousand baht.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:44.000
Hey, what did you do?

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:47.600
I thought you said you were
at the hospital. Who's this?

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.280
A mental patient
who steals people's boyfriends?

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:56.880
I’m begging you, please go home.
I’ll tell you later.

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.400
No, let’s talk now.

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:01.720
What is all this about?

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:03.280
Why did you lie to me?

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:05.680
You should go now.

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.120
I’ll explain everything.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.120
No.

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:10.560
- Let’s clear things up now.
- Mom.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.200
I want to talk to that wench too.

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:15.680
Why? Cat got your tongue?

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:17.520
Why weren’t you embarrassed
when you did it?

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:19.720
- Why so quiet now?
- Mom, let’s go home.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.680
Preem, take your mother home.

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:25.040
No. I’m not leaving
until I slap her.

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:27.800
Hey, don't.
That's enough. Let's go.

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:29.360
How many times have you lied to me?

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.440
I wasn’t thinking things through.

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:36.040
But I thought anyone who was lied to
would’ve done the same.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.720
What is this?
Why are you showing me this?

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:40.320
Trying to piss me off?

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.320
That’s Uea.

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:46.280
She was my junior
back in college.

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:50.000
She’s been flirting with me
for years.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.240
Did she study medicine too?

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:55.560
No.

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.400
She’s a librarian
at the college library.

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:01.320
I was never interested in her.

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:04.440
Until last month,

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:08.040
the college held a farewell party
for a professor.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.520
I knew him, so I went.

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.720
She was there too.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:19.400
That night,

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:22.560
I got really drunk.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:24.360
So...

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:26.160
So you slept with her.

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:27.720
No, we didn’t go that far.

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:29.960
It’s true.

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:31.800
I...

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.600
She took advantage
and clung to me.

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:36.840
Then she took photos and videos

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:39.000
to blackmail me.

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:42.400
I’m pretty sure

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.920
she knows this was a real case
at the hospital.

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:49.760
Many doctors have been fired
over things like this.

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:52.320
So she blackmailed me.

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:55.320
I had to pay her compensation.

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:00.760
She’s clearly a thief.

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.720
I don’t know what to do.

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:09.400
My world is small.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:12.440
I study all day.
I don’t have any friends.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.360
I started working
right after graduation.

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:18.040
I never expected I’d meet
someone so cruel.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:27.880
It’s okay, Ake.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.200
We’ll get through this together,
all right?

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.040
I don’t think I can take it anymore.

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.200
I’ve been under so much stress.

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:48.160
Think about it, Phare.

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:52.760
Every time I perform surgery,
I’m exhausted.

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:55.840
But I still have to drive
to her and pay,

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:58.680
just to keep her
from blackmailing me.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:07.360
All the time I’ve been with her,

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:09.080
there’s only one thing on my mind.

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.600
When will I get to see you again?

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:16.200
When will I get to play with Preem?

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.120
Phare.

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.520
I love you and Preem so much.

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:36.280
It'll be fine, Ake.

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:41.840
How much more
do you have to pay her?

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:45.280
I don’t want you to know.

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:49.080
I don’t want to worry you.
Let me carry that burden.

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:50.400
It's my fault.

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:51.520
Just tell me.

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:55.080
You've helped me so much.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:57.680
Let me help you.

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:00.840
A million baht more.

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:08.440
Once a bad person,
always a bad person.

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:11.760
She was paid,
but didn’t keep her word.

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.200
She kept bothering my boyfriend.

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:19.160
Someone like me
can’t just sit around.

00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:22.240
I had to stop her shamelessness.

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:32.880
I knew talking wouldn't work
with someone like her.

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.200
So I came up with
a plan for revenge.

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:42.760
Even though I hadn't done
much programming lately,

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:45.320
a simple task like this
wouldn't take much time.

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:46.400
(Mrs. Ueaari Jitcharoensuk
Librarian)

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:49.640
The college's security system
was so easy to hack too.

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:51.960
Excuse me.

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:55.680
Do you have any books on how to deal
with shameless people?

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:02.280
(Sluttiest Librarian of the Year)

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:06.800
- Goodbye, ma'am.
- Say bye to your teacher.

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:08.200
- Mom.
- Yes?

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.840
I want some pancakes.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.240
Just one, all right?

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:16.720
You can’t have more than that
because I’m making dinner.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000
Okay.

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:21.480
Three cream pancakes, please.

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:23.640
I said one, Preem.

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:26.400
One for you and one for Ake.

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:32.000
You’re so sweet, Preem.
You’re thinking of others.

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:33.560
Such a sweet child.

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:35.440
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:37.080
- You're welcome.
- Give us some, please.

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:40.120
Thank you.

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:52.400
What's all this?

00:18:58.720 --> 00:18:59.720
(Dangerous Woman! Possessive over
a man who doesn't want her.)

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:00.720
(I feel sorry for the child, having
a mother who has a mental illness.)

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:01.720
Huh?

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:03.720
It's her.

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:15.320
Where are you going, Mom?

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:17.400
What about the pancakes?

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.240
It's okay. You'll be fine.

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:46.240
Preem, I'm so sorry.

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.160
I'm sorry.

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:21.040
Preem.

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:25.800
What should I do to get you
to go to school?

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:29.600
You’ve already missed two days.

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.800
My friends call me
the daughter of a crazy person.

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:35.880
Can I just not go, Mom?

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:37.480
I’m embarrassed.

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:46.000
I’m embarrassed, Mom.

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:53.040
My instinct as a mother
told me to go after her

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:55.120
for hurting my daughter.

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.400
Are you insane?

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:00.680
I'll slap some sense into you.

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:02.920
I’ll protect my family
with everything I have.

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:06.440
Let go of me.

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:08.920
Hey.

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:10.920
I’ll protect my relationship too.

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:14.280
- Oh dear.
- Let go.

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:17.480
- I said stop it.
- Let go of me.

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.760
Let go of me!

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:21.800
- Stop.
- Leave my husband alone.

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:23.400
Stop.

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:25.640
- Get her out of here.
- Let go.

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:27.120
Stop them.

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:28.920
That's enough.

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.720
- Come here.
- Let go.

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:32.080
I said stop it!

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:42.080
It made me realize
that I’ve had enough of this man.

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:43.080
- Stop.
- Go away.

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:46.080
- Hey.
- Get out of my face

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:48.760
before my daughter's and my lives
get worse.

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:50.760
I'm sorry.

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:53.360
I promise this will never
happen again.

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.160
I talked to Uea.

00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:58.240
She deleted all the photos.

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:03.560
From now on,
it will just be the three of us.

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.760
No one will bother us anymore.

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:11.360
Phare.

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:14.040
Look at this document.

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.120
(Title Deed)

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:24.360
Before my father passed away,

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:27.480
he left me some land.

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:30.880
He told me to use it
to build a life.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.400
Now I know

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:38.040
that you're my life partner.

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.160
I don't want to be
just Ake to Preem.

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:49.760
I want to be her father.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.000
Please give me a chance.

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:00.760
Please.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.600
Let’s be a family again.

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:10.640
Please.

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:19.920
Phare.

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:22.960
Thank you so much.

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.520
Preem will love it.

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:35.280
A small cafe with a garden
where customers can take photos.

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:42.240
Just wait a little.

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:45.720
I’ll take on more patients
in the next few years,

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:47.800
and save up
to open that cafe for you.

00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:57.560
I don't want to wait, Ake.

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:01.000
Let's just do it.
I have some money saved up.

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:07.960
Okay.

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:20.680
(Sup Munkong Insurance)

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:34.640
I’ll get going then. Good luck.

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:36.040
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.440
Hello, Pornapha.

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:40.960
Please follow me.

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:44.000
When I ran into her again
at the insurance company,

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:47.600
I knew that someone
wasn't telling the truth.

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:50.240
Are you sure this land
belongs to you?

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:54.120
I am. I remember this tree.

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:57.800
You're being funny. This is my land.

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:03.840
Wait, why is it so empty?
It doesn’t look like his photos.

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:08.040
In his photos,
there were already foundation beams.

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:10.120
Look.

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.440
What? Hold on.

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:19.920
I got the exact same photo.

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:33.120
Ake, you scumbag!

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:45.880
He's Ake to you, huh?

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:48.720
I call him Tim.

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:52.520
So what's his real name?

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.280
Come on.

00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:58.680
Stop crying.

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:00.960
The stress is driving me insane.

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:02.800
It's killing me too.

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:05.280
I gave him one million baht.

00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:07.840
And I slept with him.

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:11.520
I gave him more than a million.

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:14.560
Sleeping with him

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:16.720
doesn’t bother me, though.

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:18.520
It was fun for me.

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:21.800
But I have a child.

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.200
She really likes him.

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:28.000
What am I supposed to tell her?

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:33.160
Oh dear.

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:45.040
"The coffee machine
imported from Italy."

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.280
"Just delivered today."

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:51.320
"Please transfer the money.
Only 350,000 baht. Such a steal."

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:04.160
"The coffee machine
imported from Italy."

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.040
"Just delivered today."

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:10.120
"Please transfer the money.
Only 350,000 baht. Such a steal."

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:15.680
Can’t he come up with
something original for once?

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:18.600
Ake, I’m not dumb.

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:21.520
How dare you try to scam me?
You’ll definitely pay for this.

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:23.920
Wait, calm down.

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:26.280
- What? I'm not done.
- Hold on.

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:27.800
Listen to me.

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:31.320
If he finds out we’re onto him

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:33.640
and runs off with our money,
then what?

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:37.160
Don’t you want your money back?

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:41.080
Calm down.

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:43.040
Let’s plan carefully.

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:46.040
We’ll outsmart him
when he least expects it.

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:51.640
Yes.

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:56.200
He scammed us,
so we scam him back.

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:02.000
Hey.

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:06.120
You can’t sit here.
It’s private property.

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.400
Get out.

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:14.720
(Rongsi Pochana)

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.000
The food here is as good as always.

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:22.680
That’s why I bring you here often.

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:27.120
Hey.

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:31.240
Did you transfer the money
for the coffee machine?

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:33.280
Not yet.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.440
I haven’t received
my insurance payout yet.

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:39.200
I'll send it as soon as I can.

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:43.400
Sure, I can wait,
but not for too long.

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:45.880
I'm afraid it might get sold
to someone else.

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:48.880
If that happens,
we’ll lose our deposit.

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:54.600
Excuse me. Check, please.

00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:05.360
I'll transfer.

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:13.720
Okay, thank you.

00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:17.880
Anywhere else you want to go?

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:20.240
- Well...
- Do you want to look at books?

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:22.280
- Sure.
- Let's go.

00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:39.320
I'll take a shower.

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:42.160
I had an outdoor shoot today.
I'm all sweaty.

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:44.960
Go ahead and wash your hair.
I'll blow dry it for you.

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:46.600
- Sure.
- Okay.

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:02.080
Why can't I log in?

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:04.080
Do I have the wrong code?

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:09.160
- Uea.
- Yes?

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:11.800
Will you bring me my phone?
I want to listen to some music.

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:13.520
Of course.

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:22.880
Are you coming?

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.200
Yes, I am.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.640
- Here.
- Thank you.

00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:45.240
What? Only a few hundred
thousand baht in his account?

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:47.360
Yes.

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:49.040
And no apps

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:53.240
for trading gold, stocks, or crypto.

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:54.760
None at all.

00:30:56.520 --> 00:31:00.320
Think carefully. Where could he
be keeping our money?

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:04.040
But he has a laptop.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.600
He spends his days playing games.

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:09.960
But he's always on it late at night.

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:13.640
I think he stores
information on it.

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:16.320
Can you log into his laptop?

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:19.120
From what I’ve seen,

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:22.680
his password is as long
as Bangkok’s full name.

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:25.240
You’re good with computers, right?

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:26.840
Can you hack it?

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:39.520
You woke me up so early.
Where are we going?

00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:41.680
I want it to be a surprise.

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:43.160
I’m sure you’ll love it.

00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:45.440
- I'll drive.
- Okay.

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:20.160
Tim.

00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:24.240
You’ve been working so hard lately.

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:26.000
You don’t get to fly often,

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:27.440
so I want you to relax.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.920
So, are you surprised?

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:32.040
Yes.

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:34.120
Very surprised.

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:40.560
As for the outfit and equipment,

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:42.600
I’ve already prepared them.

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:48.960
Okay.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.800
Hello, how is it going?

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:16.640
I’m about to send him up in the air.

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:20.280
When he found out he had to fly,

00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:22.360
his face went completely pale.

00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:24.800
Luckily, the wind’s strong today.

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:27.200
He might actually fall to his death.

00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:29.800
No, don't let him die just yet.

00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:31.880
I still can’t hack into his laptop.

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:35.000
I can only access the basic stuff.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.800
He’s installed
a tight security system.

00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:40.160
I’m sure our money’s in here.

00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:43.040
Take care of it.

00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:46.600
He’ll take a few more hours.

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:49.480
Okay, I’ll call you once I’m done.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.640
But let me know
when he’s about to leave.

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:53.840
Okay.

00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:02.400
Tim, why are you still wearing that?

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:06.160
I have diarrhea.

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:08.720
I’ve already been
to the toilet twice.

00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:11.600
I don’t think I can fly today.

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:13.440
Maybe next time.

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:16.640
Tim, you can still do it.

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:18.800
It doesn’t take much energy.

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:21.080
It’s not a good idea, Uea.

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:26.160
What if I have to go mid-air?
The farmers won't need fertilizer.

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:29.800
Come on, let them use
their own fertilizer.

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:32.120
Let’s go home.

00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:33.280
Wait, Tim.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.680
I think we should see a doctor.

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:40.360
If it’s serious,
you can get treated early.

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:42.160
It’s fine, Uea.

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:44.840
I have electrolyte powder at home.

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:47.920
I’ll be fine after I have that
and get some rest.

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:49.360
Let’s go home.

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:50.520
- I can’t hold it in. Let's go.
- Wait, Tim.

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:52.040
Oh no.

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:53.560
Ouch.

00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:57.120
What should I do?

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:04.440
Phare.

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:11.800
(Uea)

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:13.800
What?

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:16.320
Hello, Phare.
Change of plans. We’re leaving.

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:18.360
- Are you done?
- What?

00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:21.640
I need two more hours. Stall him.

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:23.640
Two hours?

00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:25.920
- Uea, what are you doing? Let’s go.
- Okay.

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:27.160
- I need to use the toilet.
- I'll do my best.

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:29.120
Okay, I'm coming.

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:43.840
Are you purposely driving slowly?
Why are you taking the long way?

00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:45.840
No.

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:47.960
I think this way is faster.

00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:53.400
I’ll find you a gas station
before we go home.

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:57.240
No, I want to use
the toilet at home.

00:36:57.880 --> 00:36:58.880
Hurry up.

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:00.560
Okay.

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:21.520
(We're here. Did you leave?)

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:28.520
We're here. Did you leave?

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:36.760
- Uea, hurry up.
- Okay.

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:40.080
Phare, did you leave?

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:46.600
- Come on.
- Tim, hold on. Wait for me.

00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:57.760
- I need to go now.
- Okay, I hear you.

00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:00.400
- Hurry up, Uea.
- Okay.

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:06.160
- Yes?
- The key?

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:08.160
Oh.

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:22.840
Is it missing?

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:24.440
Hold on.

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:27.320
I don't know where it is.

00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:29.760
Did you bring it with you
this morning?

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:32.200
I think so.

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:43.960
We're home.

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:49.400
Who are you talking to?

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:51.280
Never seen Japanese anime?

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:54.440
That’s what you’re supposed to say
when you get home.

00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:56.280
The door is not locked.

00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:30.080
Uea, I'm going to take a nap.

00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:33.120
I woke up so early this morning.
I’m exhausted.

00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:34.520
Sure.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.280
Where are you now? Did you leave?

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:45.760
No, I'm in the closet.

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:48.840
Please get him out of the room.

00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:56.520
Well, Tim.

00:39:57.560 --> 00:40:01.080
Don’t you need to use the toilet?
I’ll prepare the electrolyte powder.

00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:02.680
Well...

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:07.480
It’s fine. I feel better now.

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:09.200
I’ll feel better after a nap.

00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:26.160
- Darn it.
- What's wrong?

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:33.520
It’s nothing. I’ll be back.
I just have some errands to run.

00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:45.920
Phare.

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:51.640
I don’t know what’s wrong.
He just ran out.

00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:54.320
It was me.

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:55.800
What did you do?

00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:57.200
I texted him.

00:40:57.480 --> 00:40:59.640
I said I was bringing snacks
to the hospital.

00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:02.680
If he’s not available,
I’ll leave them at reception.

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:04.600
The truth will come out

00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:06.720
that there is no Dr. Akasit
in the department of surgery.

00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:10.440
So he has to meet you in person.

00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:12.000
You’re so smart.

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:14.040
But not as smart as he is.

00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:16.760
I dug through his laptop.

00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:18.600
No financial information.

00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:22.200
He has a lot of cash.

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:25.200
How could he keep it
without a trace?

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:28.360
Or did he put it in a jar
and bury it?

00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:30.640
It's possible.

00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:35.200
So I...

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:37.640
I brought a surveillance camera.

00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:41.880
Let’s keep an eye on him
and find out where he hid our money.

00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:49.160
Hello, I just got
out of the operating room.

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:50.760
Where are you now?

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:53.240
I already left.
I had to pick up Preem.

00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:55.120
What?

00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:58.200
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:00.000
I ran so fast I almost threw up.

00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:03.880
I’m sorry. I didn’t want
to disturb you at work.

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:09.120
Did you leave the snacks
at the reception?

00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:11.840
No, I brought them home.

00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:17.040
All right, good.

00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:19.200
Phare.

00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:22.480
Don’t bring any more snacks
to the hospital.

00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:25.320
They don’t like it
when outsiders visit.

00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:30.040
Okay, see you tomorrow.

00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:38.640
Ake, the snacks I wanted
to give you the other day.

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:41.080
It's so good. Try it.

00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:48.400
Thank you. It looks amazing.

00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:52.120
Phare.

00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:55.560
About the 350,000 baht
coffee machine,

00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:58.040
could you transfer the money now?

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:01.960
I have to pay for it this morning.

00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:04.320
This morning?

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:10.160
I haven’t received
my insurance payout yet.

00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:12.400
Please wait a few more days.

00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:18.480
Let me be honest with you.

00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:21.200
Do you have a problem with me?

00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:24.160
You’ve postponed so many times.

00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:27.680
If you don’t want to open a cafe
with me, just say so.

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:29.680
Ake.

00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:31.560
Be reasonable.

00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:34.960
I still haven’t gotten my payout.
Where else can I get the money?

00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:38.280
I’ve put so much into this cafe.

00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:39.640
Why wouldn’t I want
to make it work?

00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:46.280
Calm down.

00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:47.920
Please wait a little.

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:50.600
Once I get the payout,
I’ll transfer it right away.

00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:53.840
Okay.

00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:00.160
Is it good, dear?

00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:05.960
Goodbye, come back soon.

00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:10.040
Did he hear you?

00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:11.480
Probably not.

00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:13.640
A car’s coming.

00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:16.440
Whose car is that?

00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:32.320
Preem, say hi to Uea.

00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:34.800
Hello, Uea.

00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:36.480
Hello.

00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:38.080
Who’s she?

00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:42.360
She’s my friend.

00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:52.680
I tried to get him to talk,
but he wouldn’t say a word.

00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:56.280
All he did was ask about
the money for the coffee machine.

00:44:57.760 --> 00:44:58.840
Same here.

00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:02.360
He’s been asking me
about it all day.

00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:05.920
Never mind.

00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:10.360
Have you seen him do anything
on your surveillance camera?

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.800
Nothing useful so far.

00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:16.320
I’ll check yesterday’s footage.

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:18.600
I was with him all day.
I didn’t get the chance.

00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:22.960
Wait, why is it all black?

00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:33.160
Why’s he so messy?

00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:36.080
Can’t he hang up
his clothes properly?

00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:43.640
Try pressing play.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.000
Okay.

00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:13.720
- Got it?
- Yes.

00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:14.880
There's one more.

00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:22.720
We need a code.

00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:24.640
Do you know it?

00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:28.840
Try the old one, 565656.

00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:04.400
What?

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:09.120
Let’s go before he gets back.

00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:10.720
Let's go.

00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:18.560
Wait.

00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:21.400
What?

00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:24.600
Wait.

00:47:57.920 --> 00:47:59.760
The happiness we get from deceit

00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:03.240
will one day make us realize
that we are the fools.

00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:07.440
Why should we just let him?

00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:09.640
Let’s get our money back.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.160
What was that? I’m totally confused.

00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:15.920
Don’t be confused. He’s gay.

00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:19.440
I didn't know someone
could be that evil.

00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:21.600
A guy like him needs to face
a guy like me.

00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:22.880
I’m here today

00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:24.720
because I want to ask for your help.

00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:27.040
How do you want me to help?

00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:30.320
- Hello, are you James?
- Yes.

00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:32.280
Hello.

00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:33.360
Let me ask you something.

00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:35.160
Are you really gay, James?

00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:39.920
Hey.

00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:43.080
- This always causes me a problem.
- You saw the camera, didn't you?

00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:44.360
Yes.

00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:46.320
What's that smell? Omelet?

00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:47.880
Watch out for the smell.

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:49.680
Watch out for the smell.

00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:52.080
We can't concentrate now
because of the smell.

00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:55.400
There's wind.

00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:59.800
What? Did you just do it?

00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:01.200
Your false eyelashes are coming off.

00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:02.640
- Really?
- Yes.

00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:04.440
They came off.
