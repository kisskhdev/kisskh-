WEBVTT

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.800
Looks delicious.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.500
Christmas cake

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.360
I remember... it should be around here.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Found it.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.000
Cheers!

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.500
Happy birthday.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.060
Happy birthday to me,
celebrating on my own.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Thank you.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.500
Delicious.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.900
39th birthday.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.700
And just like that, it's over.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.869
- And now, live from the scene, it's Miki-san.
- Actually, he's at Hakkeijima Sea Paradise.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.000
They really take food seriously here.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.460
The top food recommendation
right now is this one.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.700
This is the Sparrow Chick Crepe, which
just launched last month at the Ocean Café.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.553
I'm so jealous.

00:00:59.577 --> 00:01:01.859
I heard the special thing about the baby sparrow
at the Ocean Park is how round and chubby it is!

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.329
- That's right.
- Exactly.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.500
It's really adorable.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.980
- Just looking at it on the screen, it already looks adorable.
- So cute!

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.800
That's right.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:09.300
Yes.

00:01:09.301 --> 00:01:11.800
There are also many young
customers making purchases.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.800
Alright, I'll dig in then.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.800
I'm not young anymore.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.020
I've known about this for a long time.

00:01:24.296 --> 00:01:25.150
Morning.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.150
Good morning.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.170
Morning.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.170
Good morning.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.700
Morning.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.700
Good morning.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.700
Morning.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.700
Good morning.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.300
- Morning.
- Good morning.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.800
- Morning.
- Good morning.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.200
Jujo-san.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.000
Good morning.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.800
Morning.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.700
This is my unchanging, ordinary,
and uneventful everyday life.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.410
Exactly.

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.058
And then I kept getting hit
with one tough problem after another...

00:02:04.083 --> 00:02:06.999
But right now, Tanaka-san
is handling the email replies.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.909
Ah! That's actually one of Mihashi-san's bad
habits. Hold on, I'll call over there for you.

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.599
- You saved me!
- Thank you.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.600
- Sorry to always trouble you.
- No problem.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.400
Tanaka-san, Jujo-san
said he'll take care of it.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.400
Thank you!

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.409
He is truly the boss among bosses!

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.000
Don't point your finger at your boss.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.999
- Oh, right-tomorrow night.
- Suzume!

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.449
Kuroki, just call me by my last name.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.000
Hey!

00:02:34.092 --> 00:02:38.162
Even though we started at the same time,
I still made the effort to come over.

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.600
Yeah, is there something you need?

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.600
Sorry for the trouble the Sales Department
caused you yesterday. I truly apologize.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.700
You really helped a
lot by taking care of it.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.400
That's great, Keiji.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.210
- Good job.
- Nice work, Keiji-kun!

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.800
I brought some treats as a thank you.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.699
Thank you.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.320
- There's enough for everyone! Go ahead, have a drink!
- I really appreciate it.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.499
What about tomorrow night,
like we just talked about?

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.800
Ah! It's Tanaka-san's birthday.

00:03:07.392 --> 00:03:10.968
I didn't want to be alone, I asked everyone
if they wanted to go out for a drink together.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.500
I'll pass. You young folks
go and have fun on your own.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.930
Come celebrate with us.

00:03:15.931 --> 00:03:17.000
Speaking of Suzume...

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.600
It's less of a celebration and
more like his birthday is cursed.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:22.780
Huh?

00:03:22.781 --> 00:03:25.849
- You don't know when Suzume's birthday is, Keiji-kun?
- Drop it.

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.799
It's December 24th.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.800
Don't say another word.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.600
Christmas Eve.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.949
Seriously! Thanks for the coffee.

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.000
We're heading to a meeting now.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.689
I was hoping to have a drink with everyone.

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.400
Let's head to the meeting, old-timer.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.500
Remember to drink it, okay?

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.880
Alright.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:42.260
Thank you.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.260
Thank you so much.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.600
Christmas Eve, huh...

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.300
So, how old is Jujo-san again?

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.470
37?

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:51.899
Or is it 8?

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:52.780
It's 39.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.380
So what about Christmas Eve this year?

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.200
40

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.000
"10 Things I Want to Do Before I Turn 40"
(Episode 1)

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.700
When did I stop looking
forward to my birthday?

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.000
- You're back.
- Hello.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.500
I spent my 39th birthday alone.

00:05:19.507 --> 00:05:22.567
No, actually, I spent my
38th birthday alone too.

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.700
My 37th birthday was the same.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:31.209
I've gotten used to a life where I just go
back and forth between work and home every day.

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.300
You did great today.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.200
- It's easier being on my own.
- I'm back, Susuko.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.500
This home is surrounded
by the things I love.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.100
What makes me feel the most at ease.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.400
It's just that...

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.600
Sometimes I feel uneasy.

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.400
Am I just going to keep going like this?

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:28.100
If tomorrow were the last day of your
life, what would you want to do most?

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.809
Have you noticed that, surprisingly, you're not
all that clear about what you actually want to do?

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.576
There are actually a lot of things
you've already given up on, aren't there?

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.600
Yeah, I have.

00:06:37.601 --> 00:06:39.639
You're always thinking about
reasons why you can't do it, aren't you?

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:40.915
That's right.

00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:42.200
I'm talking about you.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Today's topic is this.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.596
Make a list of things you want
to accomplish before you die.

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:49.620
Oh.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.099
Before life comes to an
end, let your spirit truly soar.

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.689
Starting now, please write down
the ten things that come to your mind.

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:56.799
Today, let's all do this together.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.300
Is this... a sign from above?

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:13.600
A bucket list for things
I want to do before I die.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.900
Things I want to do?

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.600
Have an honest conversation
with your true self.

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.880
Write down what you truly desire.

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.600
I guess it really has to start from here.

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.800
Travel around the world.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:37.800
Is there anything else?

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:39.720
The kind you often see in videos.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.000
Camping on a deserted island.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.000
Go see the Northern Lights.

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:53.000
What else?

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:55.200
Suzume-chan.

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:00.800
Is this really enough?

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:04.900
No, that's not right.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:08.500
I haven't thought about the Northern
Lights at all in the past ten years.

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:21.000
The things I truly want to do.

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.500
I heard Tanaka went on a date
with a girl he met on a dating app.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:41.450
I've already decided this year,
I'm definitely going to get a girlfriend.

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:44.100
Yeah, having a goal is a good thing.

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:45.040
That's right.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:48.099
What about you? How did things go with
the girl you went on a date with before?

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:50.100
- Last time?
- Yeah.

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:51.820
Huh? Which girl are you talking about?

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.500
Ugh! So annoying.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.039
I really want a girlfriend.

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:56.760
I really want to go on a date.

00:08:56.761 --> 00:08:58.800
There are just so many things I want to do.

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:01.600
Alright, I got it. I'll
listen to you tonight.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.200
Things I want to do?

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:31.610
Before I die.

00:09:31.611 --> 00:09:33.800
Isn't this setup a bit too long?

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.600
Before I turn 40

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:40.600
10 Things I Want to Do.

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:45.700
That's right.

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:47.700
That's about right.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.400
There are still three
months left until I turn 40.

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.900
Things I might be able to
accomplish within three months.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:04.400
Something I've always found hard to do.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:18.500
Takoyaki party.

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.600
Because you can't really have
a takoyaki party by yourself.

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.200
That's right.

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:35.400
What I want to do are
these ordinary things.

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.000
And things that just seem so natural.

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:43.180
Even though it's pretty ordinary.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:44.800
A guy in his forties.

00:10:44.801 --> 00:10:48.000
You just can't do these things alone.

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:52.800
First up, the things I long for...

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.640
Try every single cake in the
department store basement food court.

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:06.500
Other than suits and uniforms, I
honestly have no idea what else to wear.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.800
Change up my style of dressing.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:25.900
On TV

00:11:25.901 --> 00:11:27.500
I want to check out the ocean park too.

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.600
Marine Park.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:36.600
What else?

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:42.000
The ice cream parfait from Senbikiya.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.800
Get a custom-made, awesome pillow.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.800
Create an amazing custom
meal tailored just for me at a café.

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:19.400
Someone to experience it with me.

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:27.700
Find someone to fall in love with.

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:35.600
Truly...

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.000
Things I want to do

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.600
(kiss)

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.200
I really want to...

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:23.900
Be touched by someone.

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:33.600
Before I turn 40...?

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.500
Ahhh!!!

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:42.100
You... Didn't you go out for drinks?

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:45.260
No, I was thinking it'd be better
to go with Jujo-san after all.

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:46.899
Is this some kind of survey?

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:48.600
Do you still have work left to finish?

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:53.700
- No, I just finished up.
- Good job.

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.600
Everyone's waiting for
you, if you can make it.

00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:59.809
- Let's go!
- Let's head out!

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:00.590
Let's go.

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:01.220
Let's go grab a drink!

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:01.930
That's great!

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:03.889
But I still need to get ready.

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:05.500
Ah! Of course, no problem.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:07.600
Dating app.

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.290
Try using a dating
app to find a girlfriend.

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:12.900
This kind of thing is really
more suited for younger people.

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:17.899
Great at work, really gentle, and pretty
good-looking, too. But doesn't have a girlfriend.

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:19.079
Why is that?

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:21.400
Because I've never used a dating app.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:27.370
If you don't take the first step,
nothing will ever get started.

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:28.670
Come on.

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:30.700
Tell me what type of girl you like.

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:32.180
Innocent type?

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:33.060
Sexy type?

00:14:33.061 --> 00:14:36.700
- No, it's fine. I don't really care…
- The innocent type?

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.735
Jujo-san, if you don't answer,
he's just going to keep pestering you.

00:14:38.759 --> 00:14:39.396
Sexy type?

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:41.300
My current girlfriend is a G cup.

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:47.299
Why do you always get all the benefits?

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:49.300
Huh? Ouch! Are you talking about looks?

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.160
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts!

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:53.500
Got it.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.430
- Tanaka-san is really good-looking.
- Let's calm down for a moment.

00:14:57.530 --> 00:14:58.800
- Ugh...
- Oh no!

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:02.029
I'll go grab a cloth!

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:03.100
I'll go check on Tanaka.

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:04.900
Go on, hurry!

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:10.100
Sorry for making you worry.

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:14.100
He really invades other
people's privacy too much.

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:17.400
He's actually not a bad guy.

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:20.100
Even though it's a bit meddlesome.

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:27.420
Are you interested in this dating app?

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:30.100
No way.

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:33.900
Is that so...

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:49.500
There are actually this many?

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:38.000
As expected, it just can't be done.

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.900
If you don't take the first step,
nothing will ever get started.

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:09.400
Isn't that a bit too fast?

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:47.100
Well... I guess it's about
time to head home for today.

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:52.100
Does anyone need any help with anything?

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.500
No worries, I'm fine.

00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:59.900
Actually, I haven't finished
the materials for next week yet.

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:02.159
Got it.

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:04.700
Then just email it to me, and
I'll check it over the weekend.

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:07.866
- Sorry to trouble you even on your day off.
- It's really no problem, no problem at all.

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:11.600
It's Friday today, so
let's all head home early.

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:17.869
Great job.

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:20.800
Great job, and take care on your way home.

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.280
I just have this feeling...

00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:58.100
Um...

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.400
Excuse me, are you Mr. Kumasusume?

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:06.710
Um...

00:19:06.711 --> 00:19:09.391
It's not because I dislike Mr. Snowman.
Absolutely not what I meant.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000
I'm sorry.

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:17.900
My attitude just now
was really out of line.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:20.700
I'm really sorry.

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:39.000
Is it really impossible for me after all?

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:45.949
Before I turn 40.

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:47.400
So that's what it means.

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:49.949
- Ah!!
- Find a partner.

00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:52.200
Jujo-san, so you really are single!

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:54.599
I thought you were seeing
someone, just keeping it to yourself.

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:58.600
Keiji, you jerk! Keiji,
delete that right now!

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:01.500
Keiji!

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:04.399
- Jujo-san.
- What is it?

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:06.900
Do you want to complete this list with me?

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:10.700
Huh?

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:14.300
I'm just like Jujo-san.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.700
I'm gay too.

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:25.700
Takoyaki party and cake.

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:28.599
Eat ice cream sundaes
together with Jujo-san.

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:30.080
Sounds like it could be a lot of fun.

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:32.809
What are you talking about?

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:34.440
Don't you have a girlfriend?

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:36.900
That's all fake, it's
just too much trouble.

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.700
Is there anyone more
efficient than me right now?

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:47.900
If you start looking for someone now,
it's going to take a ton of time, you know.

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:59.100
That was close! I almost
let you convince me.

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:01.100
Come on... Don't mess with me.

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:07.600
Do you want me to prove it to you?

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:13.800
Are you willing to trust me now?

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.000
Jujo-san.

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:21.300
You never thought I felt
the same way, did you?

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.659
I would never do something
so stupid that I'd get caught.

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:27.660
You can relax.

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:31.900
As for whether it's safe or
not, I can't make any promises.

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:41.115
You... are just way too ridiculous.

00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:43.279
Do you know what you're doing?

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:45.600
Shouldn't you be the one who doesn't know?

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:52.000
It's absolutely no problem
if you want me to hold you.

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:02.600
That look on your face is
basically the same as admitting it.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.529
If you want to hide it, you have
to do a better job of hiding it.

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:06.719
This... this is just...

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:08.899
There are only nine things on this list.

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:11.700
- Don't mess with my computer.
- This one's already done.

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:19.500
Celebrate my birthday with my partner.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.600
Alright, that makes ten.

00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:29.900
Let's work together to achieve our goals.

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:35.000
He... he really is...

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.800
Feels like something's about to start.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.000
Suzume-chan.

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:47.399
(Next Episode)
Why buy a takoyaki maker?

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:49.089
Because it's the first thing on the list.

00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:50.779
Wait, seriously!

00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:52.959
But right now, I'm not seeing anyone.
I'm still in a “to be determined” status.

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:54.360
You've got some sauce on your face.

00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:56.299
When was your last relationship?

00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:57.369
Why are you asking all of a sudden?

00:22:57.370 --> 00:22:59.500
Just wanted to know how
long you've been single.
