WEBVTT

00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.200
Then from now on,

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.120
we have to say the same thing.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.120
Our sister is gone.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.360
And the three of us are not involved at all.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.000
Chom, my engagement ring.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.200
There’s no one here?

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.760
But I really heard a sound from here.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.199
The house is old.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.640
It’s probably a wood creaking sound.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.960
I didn’t get enough sleep lately.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.160
Yes, Inspector.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.480
Yes.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:11.960
A meeting?

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:16.960
Sure.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.120
Hey.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.720
The inspector calls an urgent meeting.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.760
Hey.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.336
You did that on purpose, didn’t you?

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.360
Did what?

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.080
You purposely sent me into the room, didn’t you?

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.080
What are you talking about?

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.560
I knew it. This is strange.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.560
You offered to help me without asking anything.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.759
You set me up to be in the room.
So the police would find me there.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.560
I found this in the room.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.720
If I planned that,

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.840
why would I go in to help you?

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.880
I would have let the police arrest you.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.320
You probably changed your mind or something.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.880
I saw the police in the house.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.080
So I sneaked in to help you.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.680
About the scissors, I didn’t put them there.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.760
This is the first time I've seen it.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.480
Then why didn’t you ask me
what I was doing in the house?

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.800
That…

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.560
That night,

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.800
I saw it.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.240
Nathat was at the house that night.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.560
But he pretended as if he had just arrived.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.960
My guess is…

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.040
you didn’t tell the police about him.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.480
You knew?

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.120
It has the date and time when the video was taken.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.280
If the police find the video,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000
do you think…

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.600
they will see Nathat as a suspect,

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:32.320
or they will think
you and Nathat were in it together?

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.840
Aren’t you underestimating me?

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.040
Don’t forget.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.720
In this world,

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.480
there’s technology called data backup.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.760
What do you want?

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.000
What?

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.760
You were the one who taught me this.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:02.920
Taught you what?

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.360
Everything has its price.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.040
It always costs you something.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:12.960
Don’t worry.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.960
I’ll keep it a secret between us.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.440
Even Nathat will not know about it.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.640
But…

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.080
I have a condition.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.160
What do you want?

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.600
I’m curious.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:45.680
Who do you love more, yourself or Nathat?

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.360
(Trust is a double-edged sword.)

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.120
(It’s not easy to build it.)

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.360
(But it’s so easy to destroy it.)

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.360
(It has a special power.)

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.880
(If you give it to the wrong man, )

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.120
(it will change you.)

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.200
(From an everyman, )

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.400
(you will become a fool.)

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.440
Damn it.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.360
2019

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.759
I’M ROOTING FOR YOU, CHOMPOO.
YOU’RE A VICTIM. STAY STRONG.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.559
YOU’RE A VICTIM. STAY STRONG.
THEY AREN’T WRONG TO TAKE THE VIDEO.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.200
I FEEL SO BAD FOR YOU, CHOMPOO.
I’M ROOTING FOR YOU.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:59.200
THOSE WHO RELEASED THE VIDEO SHOULD BE EXPOSED AND CONDEMNED.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:04.800
I…

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.440
I didn’t know how it was leaked.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.240
The problem is not how it was leaked.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.400
The problem is why it existed in the first place.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.960
I was young.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.360
I can’t turn back time and fix it.

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:32.360
Find a country for her.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.920
Somewhere far away.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.640
It would be great if it’s a rural small town.

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.640
Dad, are you sending her to study abroad?

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.920
I don’t care if she’ll study or do whatever.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.400
Cover up the scandal.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.560
Don’t let her picture be on any media.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.560
Dad, are you sending me away?

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:03.200
What about my work and life here?

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.680
You ruined it with your own hands.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:07.720
It’s not my fault.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:09.960
I didn’t mean it.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.120
I’m a victim here.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.839
Why don’t you tell
the company’s legal team to help me?

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.720
Why don’t you help me?

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.720
You want me to help you?

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.160
A slut like you?

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.040
As the old saying goes…

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:34.080
having a daughter is like
having a toilet in front of your house.

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.240
Now, I get it.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.120
I have four toilets.

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:45.360
You are the stinkiest one.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.360
Do you care about the family’s reputation…

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.920
more than me?

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:08.000
Everything has its price.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.520
Because you were born into this family.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:15.280
You have a comfortable life.

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.920
But you have a price to pay.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:22.480
You…

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.440
You didn’t use it wisely.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.760
I will never put the future of this family…

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.080
into your hands.

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:36.560
Okay.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:40.080
If you no longer think I’m your daughter,

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.680
then I’ll no longer be your daughter.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.760
I won’t take anything from this family.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.560
I won’t receive anything from you.

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.920
I’ll live on my own feet.

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.200
Chompoo.

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:10.440
Chom.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:15.480
Chom.

00:10:15.481 --> 00:10:16.560
Chompoo.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:17.960
What?

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:20.120
Calm down.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.479
Go back to apologize to Dad and talk to him.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:23.720
Apologize for what?

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.080
Didn’t you hear what he said?

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.679
Do you want me to apologize to him?

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:28.680
Chom.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:32.080
Calm down.
I think Dad is just mad.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:37.680
You may be able to endure
when he scolds or looks down on you.

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.320
But I’m not you.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.080
I have no one left.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.719
This family is not my safe zone anymore.

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:47.960
You still have me, Chom.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:55.720
I get it.
I know what you are going through.

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:58.160
But he doesn’t.

00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:59.920
You need to give him some time.

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:13.480
You did it, didn’t you?

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:16.320
What are you talking about?

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:22.280
The video that doesn’t censor my face
is posted only on Twitter.

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:23.920
Dad doesn’t use the app.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.960
Then it must be you.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:31.040
When will you stop
being jealous of your sisters?

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:33.280
How far are you going to hurt me?

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:38.960
Do you have anything I need to be jealous of?

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.040
Chat!

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.400
Chompoo.

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:44.280
Chat.

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:47.520
Just like Dad said,

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.880
The problem is not how it is leaked.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.160
The problem is
why you took the video in the first place.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.560
Get out of your bubble.

00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:59.480
This is the 21st century.

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.760
I am a victim here.

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.760
I won’t stand and let you condemn me for it.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:08.760
A victim?

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.720
Because that’s what the netizen said?

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:13.720
Because they are rooting for you?

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:16.280
In reality, is any of them on your side?

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.440
Does anyone believe what you said?

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:22.520
Everyone believes what they want to believe.

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.560
Wake up and smell the coffee, Chom.

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:30.720
In reality, you are just another woman
who is involved in a sex tape incident.

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:32.120
Chat.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:32.640
Chom.

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:33.680
Chom, calm down.

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:36.080
Chom.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.000
Chom, calm down.

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:38.040
Let me go.

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:44.440
Chat.

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.160
Are you okay?

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:37.760
Stop acting like a fool.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.160
I tell you this because I feel sorry for you.

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:43.480
Chat will never choose you.

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.439
She thinks you are easy to fool.

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:47.200
You’ll do anything that she tells you to do.

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:51.320
You’re not a donkey.
Use your brain.

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:53.480
I know that.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.080
I did everything because I love her.

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:08.120
Stop deluding yourself.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.200
We all want something in return.

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.559
When you give someone something,

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.560
you hope to get something in return.

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:19.440
Everything has its price.
It’ll cost you something.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:23.520
I’m curious.

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:25.640
You said you love her.

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:28.240
Do you love her more than yourself?

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:34.000
One day, if you find out
that everything you did is useless,

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:36.080
Will you be able to accept it?

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.120
(I’ll keep it a secret between us.)

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:03.560
(Even Nathat will not know about it.)

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:07.160
(But…)

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:10.280
(I have a condition.)

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:12.960
(What do you want?)

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:15.600
(I’m curious.)

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:21.560
(Who do you love more, yourself or Nathat?)

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:33.440
BAIBUA

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:40.720
What?

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.720
(Do you see the news on the internet?)

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:43.800
What news?

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:45.280
(It’s okay if you haven’t seen it.)

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:47.720
(You must not give an interview about it.)

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:49.520
(I’ll take care of the rest.)

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:50.840
Huh?

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:00.760
Aren’t you listening to what we just said?

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:02.239
Don’t you feel anything?

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.719
Have you no humanity left?

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.519
Do you only care about your ratings?

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:06.999
How could you do this?
Get out of my way.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.919
I USED TO FEEL BAD FOR HER DURING THE SEX TAPE INCIDENT. NOW, SHE’S ACTING CHILDISH.

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:10.879
AMONG THE SISTERS, SHE’S THE CRINGIEST.

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:12.879
SHE RUINS THE GOOD REPUTATION
HER SISTERS HAVE BUILT.

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:14.839
CHOMPOO USED TO
DATE CHATFAH’S FIANCÉE, RIGHT?

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:16.839
TO BE HONEST, SHE’S THE MOST SUSPICIOUS.

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:18.719
THE REPORTERS HADN’T SAID ANYTHING.

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:20.639
BUT SHE ALREADY GOT UPSET
AS IF SHE DID SOMETHING WRONG.

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:22.880
YOU KILLED YOUR SISTER, DIDN’T YOU?

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:37.400
Nathat.

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:38.880
What are you doing here?

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:40.440
Did your grandma know about this?

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.880
I lied to her, saying that I had work to do.

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.080
Don’t worry about the news.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.520
About the photos,
I think the media still doesn’t know about it.

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.160
Whoever sent them
hasn’t told the media about it.

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.400
I came to see you today.

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:09.000
I’m here to tell you
that I’m going to hold a press conference.

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.960
I’m going to tell the truth
about what happened that night.

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:16.000
So you will no longer be the suspect.

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:19.280
A victim?

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:22.240
Because that’s what the netizen said?

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:24.240
Because they are rooting for you?

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:26.880
In reality, is any of them on your side?

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:29.960
Does anyone believe what you said?

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:33.800
Everyone believes what they want to believe.

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.520
Let’s call it quits.

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:40.880
Chom.

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:47.120
Our relationship,

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.360
it’s wrong from the beginning.

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:53.600
This is the consequence.

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:57.080
We did things that we shouldn’t do.

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.440
We started on the wrong track.

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:03.760
We can never get it right.

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:07.960
Chom, you know that I love you.

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:09.880
I don’t love Chatfah.

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.239
I have to marry her because…

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:13.320
She’s pregnant.

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:17.320
I know.

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.600
I’ve known for some time.

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:24.200
You slept with her while we were dating.

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:27.640
I pretended that I didn’t know.

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:31.160
I thought it was love.

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:37.680
Chom.

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:39.800
I love you.

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:43.520
If Chat didn’t force me…

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:44.960
It doesn’t matter anymore.

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:49.960
We came too far.

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:55.480
You should leave.

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.760
If someone sees you, things will get worse.

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:03.840
Chom.

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:07.920
I want to be with you.

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:11.520
I want to fight through this with you.

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.400
Fight for what?

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:20.760
So I will become a suspect?

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:27.560
We will waste years in court to prove that we are innocent.

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.560
No one will believe us.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.720
Let’s end it here.

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:40.360
Before our lives are ruined.

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:56.640
YOU ARE NEXT.

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:06.480
I’m sorry.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:21.080
Hey.

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:22.480
Hey.

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:31.520
How is your car?

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:33.160
Did the mechanics say anything?

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:35.640
They said it’s a brake fluid leak.

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:37.960
Did they find anything unusual?

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:39.920
No.

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:46.160
Thank you for helping me yesterday.

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:49.720
I’m glad that you’re safe.

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:56.080
About what you said yesterday,

00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:00.640
I don’t have any prejudice
when investigating this case.

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:08.120
You didn’t think I sabotaged your brake, right?

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:10.000
Did you?

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:12.920
If I were going to take revenge on you,

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:14.720
why would I help you?

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:18.360
You might try to fool me
that you are a good cop.

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:20.120
I think you read fiction too much.

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:28.560
You used to laugh a lot.

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:41.920
Look at everything that happened lately.

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:45.960
How can anyone laugh?

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:53.080
Do you really have no clue…

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:56.720
what happened to your sister?

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:04.760
If I knew, you wouldn’t be sitting here.

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:09.520
Do you think she may be safe,

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:12.320
but she’s lying low somewhere?

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:14.400
We…\

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:18.080
We used all the manpower that we had
to find her.

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:20.800
The wood is big.

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:25.000
I don’t think she can go far by herself,

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:27.440
if she was injured like you said.

00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:32.000
My sister is hiding in the woods?

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:34.720
No way.

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.480
She loves comfort more than anything.

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:41.600
If you told me she was hiding at her condo,

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:42.640
that might be possible.

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:50.600
Do you really think she would go to her condo?

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:52.840
No.

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:55.360
Her injury was serious.

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:57.456
There’s no way she can go there by herself.

00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:00.240
I have another question.

00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:09.360
Are you sure that she was stabbed?

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:16.640
Why did you come to buy coffee at this café?

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:19.360
You usually go to the café
at the corner of the street.

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:22.280
This café is more interesting.

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:28.160
Don’t tell me that you are interested in this sister?

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:30.640
Yes, I am.

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:32.320
But not in the way that you think.

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.280
What did you talk to her about?

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:40.040
I only asked her the questions that I had.

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:42.920
From her reactions,

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:45.560
I think she’s hiding something.

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:47.760
So?

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:48.800
Shall we follow her?

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:51.520
No.

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:53.080
She will come to us.

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:03.120
What’s up, Pi?

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.360
Do you think Chat would go back to her room?

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:06.720
Her condo?

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:09.760
With the injury, she couldn’t walk.

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:11.960
That’s what I think, too.

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:17.000
But are we sure that she was stabbed?

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:19.840
What do you mean?

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:21.800
I…

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:26.080
Forget it.

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:28.680
But…

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:30.920
Bua, do you have the keycard to her condo?

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:32.800
No.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.400
But I have a way to get it.

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:41.800
The police told me to check her room.

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:44.280
Maybe I’ll find some leads.

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:45.919
I saw the news.

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:48.360
We are worried about Miss Chat.

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:51.280
If there’s anything I can help you with,
please let me know.

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:53.280
Thank you.

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:54.320
Yes.

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:17.120
Bua.

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:21.240
How are you?

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:25.160
Since the incident, I haven’t checked on you.

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:27.760
What did the police say?

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:32.360
There are no new updates yet.

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:35.360
Right.

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:38.680
That night,

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:41.120
where were you?

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:46.760
I told you.

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:49.456
The on-grid solar system on the farm was broken.

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:51.240
I went there to fix it.

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:55.240
Otherwise, the farm would be out of power at night.

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:03.600
To be honest,

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:06.320
I don’t want to rush this.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.280
But…

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:11.960
If Chatfah is gone,

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:14.800
the distribution of his assets
will be different, right?

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:18.880
She is only missing.

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:20.560
She’s not dead yet.

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:24.400
That’s not what I mean.

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:28.760
I think we shouldn’t talk about it yet.

00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:18.520
MEET WITH MANGKORN.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.040
Mangkorn?

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.080
God Gem?

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:44.360
It’s so pretty.

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:47.240
It looks so glam.

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:50.960
I’m working really hard on this collection.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.240
I hope that my brand will set new trends.

00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:57.360
Does it look pretty?

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:03.560
I’ll go take a shower.

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:48.160
The police also asked me about it.

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:49.480
I told them the truth.

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:52.759
Mr. Kajorn came here that night.

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:56.080
The solar system went down earlier that day.

00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:57.760
I think he came here to solve it.

00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:01.160
Did anyone see him here?

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:03.280
He went to my house to get the key.

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:07.120
Did he fix it?

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:08.160
No.

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:12.320
At night, we use power from an electrical grid.

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:14.800
We could wait to call a technician in the morning.

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:16.880
Does it mean…

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:20.200
Uncle Kajorn didn’t need to come here?

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:22.200
He was probably worried about it.

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:26.600
He might want to check the new lot of pesticides

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:28.000
which was delivered recently.

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:30.400
Pesticides?

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:31.440
Yes.

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:41.640
He came to check them
every time they were delivered.

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:46.000
Are these all pesticides?

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:49.480
Do we need this much pesticide?

00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:52.600
I have reported it to the head office.

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:56.240
Some lots were too big.

00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:58.280
It was too big to store them all in our warehouse.

00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:01.880
Instead, Mr. Kajorn approved
building a new warehouse.

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:06.640
But why did he need to supervise it?

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:08.960
It’s not an important matter.
Workers can do it.

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:11.360
He might get used to doing it.

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:15.920
He has been doing this
since Mr. Asok was still alive.

00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:20.720
Thank you.

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:23.080
I’ll take a look around.

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:27.560
Don’t tell anyone that I’m here.

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:30.720
Reporters keep an eye on us.

00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:33.000
I don’t want anything to affect Chat’s case.

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:35.400
Yes.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.000
You.

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:11.480
You.

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:25.880
I’m so sorry for being late.

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:28.120
I couldn’t sleep last night.

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:29.200
I’m sorry.

00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:30.456
I texted you that you don’t need to come.

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:31.360
What are you doing here?

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:32.040
I rushed here.

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:32.800
So I didn’t check your message.

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:34.160
Am I going to work with her?

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:35.760
No, it’s not about that.

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:38.080
It’s about the news on X last night.

00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:39.360
What news?

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:43.200
What news?

00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:44.760
You haven’t seen it?

00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:53.560
HIS FIANCÉE WENT MISSING
BUT HE WENT TO HER SISTER’S CONDO.

00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:59.560
Although the investigation is not over,

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:02.360
people have already judged you.

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:05.320
I think you need to take a break
for the meantime.

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:06.840
I’ll cover your work for you.

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:10.440
I feel bad for you.

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:23.440
What?

00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:25.520
I went to the farm.

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:29.080
I found what you have been hiding all these years.

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:30.840
What did you find?

00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:32.800
The pesticides that you ordered.

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:36.880
It exceeds the amount allowed by the law.

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:40.856
I checked the pesticide order records
in the past several years.

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:43.720
The records were falsified.

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:48.320
The amount that you ordered,

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:54.840
it’s large enough
to cause contamination and pollution.

00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:58.079
If the evidence is leaked,

00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:01.520
our company will lose the pollution lawsuit.

00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:06.360
You will be responsible for it.

00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:10.600
Why did you order a larger amount
than we need?

00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:13.480
Is this a corruption?

00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:16.360
Did you have a deal with the supplier?

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:19.760
Did you use our company to launder money?

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:22.880
You said you have evidence.

00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:24.560
How much do you know?

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:28.040
I have enough evidence to send you to jail.

00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:32.960
But you have been working for my dad
for a long time.

00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:35.880
I’ll give you a chance.

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:39.520
Shall I tell this to the executive board?

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:41.920
Or will you confess it to them?

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:46.240
It’s up to you.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.360
You have the evidence.

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:55.760
The meeting room is ready.

00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:03.440
You don’t need to attend it if you don’t want

00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:06.320
But I want you to submit your resignation
as soon as possible.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000
We can talk about the company’s shares later.

00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:11.760
From now on,

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:15.120
I’ll take care of my dad’s company.

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:20.360
I’m glad…

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:23.160
to see that you became more competent.

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:29.960
I also believe
that your dad would be proud of you.

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:32.760
But you know what?

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:37.320
Intelligence is a double-edged sword.

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:41.960
If you are overconfident in your intelligence,

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:46.600
sometimes, you can turn into a fool.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.800
You can say whatever you want.

00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:52.720
I already have the evidence.

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:54.880
Evidence?

00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:58.480
Do you mean this?

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:14.360
APPROVED BY
MR. ASOKSAPUN BUPPHACHINDA
CHEMICALS – FIVE MILLION BAHT.

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:22.560
He would never do this.

00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:25.440
How well do you think you know your dad?

00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:29.240
Are you sure
you know everything that he did?

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:40.800
I told you.

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:45.760
If you are overconfident in your intelligence,

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:48.320
you will turn into…

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:50.360
a fool.

00:36:56.560 --> 00:37:02.440
I knew that
Chatfah gave you my collection’s information.

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:04.720
In exchange, you would hire her
as your brand ambassador.

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:07.600
Your company is the market leader.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.960
So my sister used this tactic
to gain advantages.

00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:13.640
Do you have evidence to prove it, Miss Picha?

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:19.720
I found the sketches of my latest collection
in her condo.

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:26.840
I came to meet you today to tell you this.

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:30.600
This will be the last time
you will have my sketches.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.560
If your company tries to copy my designs again,

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:35.960
I’ll meet you in court,

00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:38.120
not in a café.

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:46.440
What you should worry about is not my company.

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:49.160
What do you mean?

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:52.960
We are not the only brand
your sister wanted to work with.

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:04.760
Chat, where did you get the puppy from?

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:06.880
Parn said it sneaked through the fence.

00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:09.079
Dad told Aunt Chom to get rid of it.

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:11.960
But Parn hid it and gave it to me.

00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:14.360
Dad told Aunt Chom to get rid of it.

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:17.200
It means that he doesn’t allow us to keep it.

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:20.080
But I want to keep it.
I’ll secretly raise it.

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:23.240
Go, little fluffball.

00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:29.960
If Dad finds out, you will be scolded, Chat.

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:32.960
Then don’t tell him, Pi.

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:35.440
Keep it a secret between us.

00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:41.320
What did you do?

00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:45.960
I told Chom to get rid of it.

00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:48.200
Why is it here?

00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:50.360
I don’t know.

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:52.520
You are playing in the garden all day.

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:54.520
There are dog footprints everywhere.

00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:55.920
How can you say you don’t know?

00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:00.400
Who took it here and did this to it?

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:01.680
Answer me.

00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:03.280
Pi did it.

00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:07.920
You did it?

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:08.960
Ouch.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.000
Ouch.

00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:11.920
Ouch.

00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:12.920
Miss Pi.

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:13.960
Miss Pi.

00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:15.280
Miss Pi.

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:17.400
Picha.

00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:19.040
Picha.

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:20.360
Picha.

00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:22.080
Miss Pi.

00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:34.880
Nathat is here.

00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:37.560
Mr. Nathat, please answer us.

00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:41.680
What is the nature of your relationship
with Chompoo, Chatfah’s sister?

00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:44.696
There’s a rumor that you were with Chompoo
on the night that Chatfah went missing.

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:45.840
Is it true?

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:47.880
Please answer the question.

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:48.960
Please answer us.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:50.680
Please answer the questions.

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:53.800
Officer.

00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:56.000
I came here to tell the truth.

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:02.840
The truth is that Chompoo has an alibi.

00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:05.440
Her alibi is…

00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:07.160
She was with me.

00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:16.280
That night,

00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:18.360
she was with me.

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:36.520
You are Chatfah’s sister.

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:40.160
In the intestate succession hierarchy,
your rank is higher than mine.

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:45.200
But I think you are stressed about finding her.

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:50.240
Why don’t you let me
handle the appointment of the executor?

00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:56.360
It will be good if you step in to help her.

00:40:56.400 --> 00:41:00.440
Since you are currently
the acting president of the company.

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:11.880
Yes.

00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:16.760
NESS (MY SECRETARY)

00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:20.320
Hello.

00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:24.400
Miss Pi, our design has been chosen.

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:27.216
They want us to speed up the production
as fast as possible.

00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:29.600
So we can have an opening
in Dubai next month.

00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:43.480
I believe what you and your sister told me.

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:46.640
After the accident,

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:49.520
you all went back to your rooms.

00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:56.200
We found blood on the stairs and in your rooms.

00:41:57.400 --> 00:41:59.040
But there’s one thing I don’t understand.

00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:04.600
Why did we find blood in Chatfah’s room?

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:07.840
One more thing,

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:10.920
the important thing
that shouldn’t have been missing,

00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:12.760
it went missing that night.

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:17.760
Do you know…

00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:20.680
where her phone is?

00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:29.920
I don’t know.

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:46.280
(Dad always told us.)

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:13.280
You made the right decision.

00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:33.120
(We are family. We need to love,
help, and take care of each other.)

00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:37.640
(But he never told us to trust each other.)

00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:40.920
I understand how you feel.

00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:43.840
Siblings,

00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:48.320
They are enemies
who were born from the same parents.

00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:51.800
The difference is…

00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:56.520
your dad was luckier than I.

00:43:58.080 --> 00:43:59.760
He got everything before me.

00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:02.840
Now,

00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:06.560
it’s my time.

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:15.040
(Because it’s hard
to understand the human mind.)

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:19.920
(We never know when we will become a fool.)

00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:28.360
(So don’t trust anyone.)

00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:36.560
(Not even yourself.)

00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:55.960
Someone called to tell the police that they saw me walk out of the mansion with bloody scissors.

00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:57.440
Are you looking for the scissors?

00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:01.480
I don’t know who sent it.

00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:05.520
Picha.

00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:08.560
In this notebook, she was going to meet Mangkorn.

00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:10.520
Chat was hiding something from us.

00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:12.160
You killed Chatfah, didn’t you?
