Law and The City

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:09.987
CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, EVENTS,
AND PLACES IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

00:01:40.267 --> 00:01:43.020
{\an8}SEOUL NAT'L UNIV OF EDUCATION STATION

00:01:44.688 --> 00:01:46.648
This stop is
Seoul Nat'l Univ. of Education.

00:01:46.732 --> 00:01:48.900
- Excuse me.
- Court and Prosecutors' Office.

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:51.695
The doors are on your right.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.450
Passengers headed toward Daehwa,
Gupabal, or Ogeum Stations…

00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:59.202
Here, we have a man.

00:02:10.922 --> 00:02:12.799
A black suit and a white shirt.

00:02:13.925 --> 00:02:16.970
Judging from his face,
he slept with his tie on last night.

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:20.849
His commute takes him 30 minutes
by subway on Line 3,

00:02:20.932 --> 00:02:23.810
but he appears exhausted,
as if it were a three-year trek.

00:02:24.936 --> 00:02:26.188
Dozing from fatigue,

00:02:26.271 --> 00:02:29.191
he still wakes up a station
before his stop like a professional.

00:02:34.363 --> 00:02:37.658
{\an8}His office is in Seocho-dong,
where there are more law firms

00:02:37.741 --> 00:02:39.117
{\an8}than restaurants.

00:02:39.201 --> 00:02:41.036
SEOUL NAT'L UNIV OF EDUCATION

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:44.122
{\an8}He has the spirit
of a worn-out office worker who'd say,

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.751
{\an8}"We all carry resignation letters
in our hearts."

00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:49.169
{\an8}Damn, it's freezing.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.382
{\an8}But he does everything asked of him
and never complains.

00:02:53.965 --> 00:02:55.467
{\an8}A textbook employee.

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:00.806
{\an8}In Seocho-dong,
where most don't last five years

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:04.518
{\an8}and go solo or become in-house counsel,
he's about to break the record.

00:03:06.561 --> 00:03:11.066
{\an8}His workday stretches on forever,
but he always punches in on time.

00:03:11.608 --> 00:03:14.695
{\an8}He's a salaried associate attorney
in his ninth year.

00:03:14.778 --> 00:03:17.406
{\an8}ASSOCIATE
A LAWYER AND AN EMPLOYEE OF A LAW FIRM

00:03:18.156 --> 00:03:21.201
He steps into the elevator
of Hyungmin Building

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.204
yearning for the far-off time
to clock out.

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:28.333
He lets out a sigh as short as a yawn.

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:35.006
You're here early.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.843
At this moment,
the man speaks to someone.

00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:40.345
Doesn't all that talking this early
wear you out?

00:03:43.265 --> 00:03:45.934
I talk because I'm tired.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.812
{\an8}Hey. I barely dragged myself out

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:50.772
- for a morning meeting.
- Later.

00:03:50.856 --> 00:03:53.733
On my way here,
I got a text saying it's delayed. When?

00:03:53.817 --> 00:03:55.819
At 8:35 a.m.

00:03:55.902 --> 00:03:57.154
People have no manners.

00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:59.364
Like you, Juhyeong,
who asks and just leaves!

00:04:01.867 --> 00:04:04.453
LAW GROUP KYUNGMIN

00:04:04.536 --> 00:04:06.538
- Good morning.
- Hello.

00:04:07.414 --> 00:04:08.457
Good morning, sir.

00:04:10.834 --> 00:04:13.545
ATTORNEY AHN JUHYEONG

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:47.871
Man, I don't want to do this.

00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:05.847
Hi.

00:05:10.894 --> 00:05:13.230
How about looking with your eyes open?

00:05:14.022 --> 00:05:15.649
- When did you get home?
- 2:00 a.m.

00:05:15.732 --> 00:05:19.277
Hey! Good morning, everybody.

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.488
You waltzed out without a briefcase?

00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:23.740
I got here earlier.

00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:28.745
I had a meeting this morning,
so I barely dragged myself out.

00:05:28.829 --> 00:05:30.789
But I got a text saying it was delayed.

00:05:32.666 --> 00:05:36.044
When? At 8:35 a.m.

00:05:37.504 --> 00:05:39.798
People have no manners.

00:05:40.966 --> 00:05:44.344
There are three of us here,
and Sanggi only presses his floor.

00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:48.223
People like you…

00:05:48.306 --> 00:05:50.267
I'll press it for you next time

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:51.893
All talk, as usual

00:05:51.977 --> 00:05:54.062
Better than nothing at all

00:05:54.145 --> 00:05:55.146
Geez.

00:05:57.274 --> 00:06:00.193
- Is today Munjeong's trial?
- She wouldn't be here yet either way.

00:06:00.277 --> 00:06:01.695
That is true.

00:06:01.778 --> 00:06:02.821
I'm off!

00:06:02.904 --> 00:06:04.823
Right! What should we have for lunch?

00:06:04.906 --> 00:06:07.701
Munjeong said she wanted
bean sprout soup yesterday.

00:06:07.784 --> 00:06:10.036
What are we going to eat?

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.621
See you later on the fifth floor!

00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:14.082
Changwon's so upbeat
this early in the morning.

00:06:14.165 --> 00:06:15.166
{\an8}SELL

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.210
{\an8}So chaotic.

00:06:17.294 --> 00:06:18.753
And nice!

00:06:20.088 --> 00:06:21.548
- Did you profit?
- I did.

00:06:21.631 --> 00:06:23.216
- How much?
- 8,800 won.

00:06:41.067 --> 00:06:43.486
The defendant did not murder the victim.

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.240
The real perpetrator
was a third person at the scene.

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:50.076
Your Honor!

00:06:50.744 --> 00:06:52.746
The defendant did not murder the victim.

00:06:53.913 --> 00:06:55.332
At the time of the incident,

00:06:55.832 --> 00:06:57.459
rather than the victim or defendant

00:06:57.542 --> 00:07:00.754
the real perpetrator
was a third person at the scene.

00:07:02.547 --> 00:07:04.257
There's a witness outside the door…

00:07:06.301 --> 00:07:07.552
who can reveal all of this.

00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:22.942
Nice.

00:07:29.407 --> 00:07:31.576
{\an8}FIRST-YEAR ATTORNEY

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:37.874
Hello.

00:07:41.211 --> 00:07:43.421
SECOND YEAR

00:07:43.505 --> 00:07:45.715
I'm just so frustrated.

00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:48.176
I didn't hit anyone.

00:07:49.803 --> 00:07:51.346
All I did was get hit.

00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:55.183
This is so unfair!

00:07:56.434 --> 00:07:57.435
Seriously…

00:07:59.562 --> 00:08:01.272
This is so unfair.

00:08:34.222 --> 00:08:35.724
THIRD YEAR

00:08:43.773 --> 00:08:45.942
I'm not suing for the money.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.487
That young man behaved so badly.

00:08:49.571 --> 00:08:51.614
It's just to teach him
some life experience,

00:08:52.282 --> 00:08:54.242
so feel free to take it easy.

00:08:54.325 --> 00:08:56.745
Still, you should get paid
for what you're owed.

00:08:58.288 --> 00:08:59.456
Gosh, no need.

00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:00.957
I don't want that money.

00:09:06.087 --> 00:09:07.714
Look at this, Your Honor.

00:09:07.797 --> 00:09:09.841
How could anyone pay for this?

00:09:12.635 --> 00:09:14.471
Hey, how could you lose?

00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:16.222
You told me not to worry!

00:09:16.306 --> 00:09:18.725
I needed to get that money, you bastard!

00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:21.061
We couldn't win with a product like that.

00:09:21.144 --> 00:09:22.687
What did you say, you bastard?

00:09:22.771 --> 00:09:24.773
- You son of a…
- Sir!

00:09:24.856 --> 00:09:26.816
Sir! Please!

00:09:48.171 --> 00:09:51.883
EIGHTH-YEAR ATTORNEY

00:09:55.929 --> 00:09:57.972
- This is delicious.
- That's right.

00:09:58.056 --> 00:09:59.933
Another bottle of soju, please!

00:10:00.975 --> 00:10:02.102
This is good.

00:10:02.185 --> 00:10:04.646
Ma'am, over here. More meat, please.

00:10:04.729 --> 00:10:06.231
Here's your chicken feet.

00:10:07.023 --> 00:10:08.316
NINTH YEAR

00:10:19.744 --> 00:10:22.539
In court, I must stand by my client.

00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:25.625
But that doesn't mean
I have to be their friend.

00:10:26.668 --> 00:10:28.920
It took me nine years to figure that out.

00:10:36.136 --> 00:10:37.262
TODAY'S CASES

00:10:53.987 --> 00:10:55.238
Let's go!

00:11:03.746 --> 00:11:04.789
Your Honor.

00:11:05.373 --> 00:11:08.251
There's a witness outside the door
who can reveal all of this.

00:11:09.085 --> 00:11:10.086
Your Honor.

00:11:10.837 --> 00:11:13.256
I'd like to call a witness on this matter.

00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:20.013
We'll proceed with the next case.

00:11:20.096 --> 00:11:22.682
Civil case number 2024-3923.

00:11:31.649 --> 00:11:33.151
Who's representing the plaintiff?

00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:37.197
I'm Ahn Juhyeong with Law Group Kyungmin,
attorney for the plaintiff.

00:11:40.658 --> 00:11:43.244
Yes, that part was stated
in the previous preparations.

00:11:44.746 --> 00:11:46.039
Your Honor!

00:11:51.586 --> 00:11:52.754
Your Honor?

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.717
Please sit down
and speak into the microphone.

00:11:58.968 --> 00:12:00.011
Yes, Your Honor.

00:12:00.094 --> 00:12:02.096
{\an8}DEFENDANT, PLAINTIFF

00:12:09.479 --> 00:12:10.647
{\an8}I, the counsel--

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:13.107
{\an8}You're the attorney
for the defendant, correct?

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:15.568
Yes.

00:12:16.527 --> 00:12:18.363
I, the…

00:12:18.446 --> 00:12:21.532
I, the counsel, would like to call…

00:12:23.243 --> 00:12:24.827
a witness on this matter.

00:12:42.428 --> 00:12:45.056
Okay, please go back
and submit the witness application.

00:12:47.016 --> 00:12:48.059
What?

00:12:49.435 --> 00:12:50.478
But…

00:12:51.312 --> 00:12:54.774
- The witness is here today in person.
- So?

00:12:54.857 --> 00:12:57.402
There's no stenographer, no time.
Nothing's ready.

00:12:59.404 --> 00:13:00.947
Your Honor!

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:04.450
Then, may I at least explain
the purpose of the witness request?

00:13:09.539 --> 00:13:12.125
I have dozens of hearings
to get through just today.

00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:14.669
Even if you explain it now,
I won't remember it.

00:13:14.752 --> 00:13:16.087
Submit it in writing.

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:21.968
The next hearing
will be on January 14th at 4:00 p.m.

00:13:22.051 --> 00:13:23.094
Is that okay?

00:13:23.886 --> 00:13:25.471
The plaintiff's counsel agrees.

00:13:25.555 --> 00:13:26.681
And the defense counsel?

00:13:28.057 --> 00:13:29.100
What?

00:13:31.561 --> 00:13:34.314
Right. I'm sorry. One second, please.

00:13:37.191 --> 00:13:38.359
What day was that again?

00:13:38.443 --> 00:13:40.361
- The 14th.
- The 14th…

00:13:43.531 --> 00:13:46.659
Yes, I believe I'm available as well.

00:13:58.129 --> 00:13:59.547
I'm sorry, sir.

00:14:04.635 --> 00:14:07.805
Don't learn how to defend cases
from TV shows.

00:14:07.889 --> 00:14:10.016
Come early
and study the earlier hearings.

00:14:11.434 --> 00:14:12.769
Okay. Thank you.

00:14:13.478 --> 00:14:16.230
No one's ever pointed that out before.

00:14:16.814 --> 00:14:18.441
I didn't say that to be thanked.

00:14:18.524 --> 00:14:20.818
It's because you dragged this trial out.

00:14:23.738 --> 00:14:27.492
Besides, that show's about criminal cases.
This is a civil case.

00:14:27.575 --> 00:14:28.951
At least watch the right show.

00:14:42.298 --> 00:14:44.592
I'll get it all ready
and mail it to you.

00:14:49.013 --> 00:14:50.348
Okay.

00:14:50.848 --> 00:14:51.849
What?

00:14:52.391 --> 00:14:55.186
No, I'm on the subway.

00:14:55.978 --> 00:14:57.271
It's unusually quiet today.

00:14:58.606 --> 00:15:00.191
- Anyway--
- Try to be on time.

00:15:00.274 --> 00:15:01.692
Yes, sir!

00:15:01.776 --> 00:15:02.860
Yes, yes.

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:08.616
Right?

00:15:10.868 --> 00:15:12.703
- Attorney Ahn, you're late.
- Hey!

00:15:26.843 --> 00:15:30.096
These are last week's rulings
on the Tech Kori case

00:15:31.222 --> 00:15:33.099
and the Seoul General case.

00:15:33.683 --> 00:15:35.268
You won both cases.

00:15:36.102 --> 00:15:37.812
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

00:15:41.274 --> 00:15:44.235
This one's the ruling
on Park Jeongeun's case.

00:15:44.819 --> 00:15:46.863
You lost this one.

00:15:46.946 --> 00:15:48.406
Okay, thank you.

00:15:52.451 --> 00:15:57.832
Mr. Na wanted you to take
a consultation on an assault case.

00:15:58.291 --> 00:15:59.292
Now?

00:16:00.543 --> 00:16:02.962
Yes, are you busy?

00:16:05.715 --> 00:16:07.633
No, orders are orders.

00:16:07.717 --> 00:16:08.759
I'll be right there.

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:13.764
ATTORNEY AHN JUHYEONG

00:16:13.848 --> 00:16:15.349
MANAGING PARTNER
NA KYUNGMIN

00:16:25.568 --> 00:16:27.111
Attorney Ahn treats me the same.

00:16:27.195 --> 00:16:29.447
Don't mind him.
He gets the job done though.

00:16:33.618 --> 00:16:38.414
Do lawyers usually not care
about winning or losing?

00:16:43.085 --> 00:16:44.086
Goddamn it!

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:45.171
CASE DENIED

00:16:45.254 --> 00:16:46.297
This sucks.

00:16:50.218 --> 00:16:51.385
Yes.

00:16:51.469 --> 00:16:52.803
Yes, please proceed.

00:16:52.887 --> 00:16:54.013
Okay, thank you.

00:16:58.476 --> 00:16:59.477
Hello?

00:17:00.019 --> 00:17:01.062
Yes, put him through.

00:17:03.064 --> 00:17:04.482
Attorney Yu Dongwook speaking.

00:17:18.037 --> 00:17:19.121
Good luck, sir.

00:17:23.584 --> 00:17:25.002
Please go over these too.

00:17:25.086 --> 00:17:27.004
- Ma'am--
- Can you do it by tonight?

00:17:27.546 --> 00:17:28.923
Okay, then. Tomorrow night.

00:17:32.593 --> 00:17:34.387
For goodness' sake.

00:17:43.312 --> 00:17:45.731
Busy, right?
I told them to throw in a bonus.

00:17:45.815 --> 00:17:48.025
You'll get it soon. Going somewhere?

00:17:52.113 --> 00:17:53.656
LAW OFFICE HOJEON 1 MILLION WON

00:17:56.033 --> 00:17:57.034
By tonight?

00:17:57.118 --> 00:17:58.202
By lunch.

00:17:58.286 --> 00:17:59.287
Okay.

00:18:12.925 --> 00:18:15.386
- Attorney Cho, take this consultation.
- Right now?

00:18:16.304 --> 00:18:18.055
I have a meeting in 10 minutes.

00:18:18.139 --> 00:18:19.849
You can finish in 10 minutes, then.

00:18:20.433 --> 00:18:23.144
It's likely just another drifter
from the streets of Seocho.

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:25.563
If they won't hire, walk out.

00:18:28.691 --> 00:18:29.734
What?

00:18:31.777 --> 00:18:33.446
I understand, sir.

00:18:38.492 --> 00:18:40.369
He's always dumping grunt work on me.

00:18:45.625 --> 00:18:47.960
Is there any way you could make it work?

00:18:50.671 --> 00:18:53.007
Well, it's just that…

00:18:55.384 --> 00:18:59.180
This is our community leader.

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:03.684
She always comes with me
to my consultations.

00:19:03.768 --> 00:19:08.481
I'm telling you
she's great at reading people.

00:19:11.692 --> 00:19:12.943
Sir.

00:19:13.444 --> 00:19:14.445
Yes?

00:19:16.572 --> 00:19:20.034
You have such great energy.

00:19:20.117 --> 00:19:21.118
Is that so?

00:19:21.702 --> 00:19:24.830
You have a face full of fortune.

00:19:25.748 --> 00:19:27.041
Let him handle the case.

00:19:27.124 --> 00:19:28.876
You'll definitely win.

00:19:29.794 --> 00:19:31.212
My goodness!

00:19:31.295 --> 00:19:34.590
She said we'll definitely win, sir!

00:19:34.674 --> 00:19:36.050
Wait, but…

00:19:37.468 --> 00:19:40.262
What makes you say I have good energy?

00:19:41.097 --> 00:19:45.434
I've often heard I have nice ears.
Would you like to take a look?

00:19:55.111 --> 00:19:56.696
Your hearing's tomorrow?

00:19:58.114 --> 00:20:00.700
I was debating it for a while,
so I'm a little late.

00:20:00.783 --> 00:20:01.784
I see.

00:20:02.493 --> 00:20:04.870
You got a suspended sentence
in the first trial.

00:20:04.954 --> 00:20:07.164
The charge was injury, not assault.

00:20:07.248 --> 00:20:08.374
Sentence in April…

00:20:09.417 --> 00:20:10.418
was suspended.

00:20:11.669 --> 00:20:14.547
Why appeal when you admitted
to everything in the first trial?

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:17.258
The truth is, I didn't hit him.

00:20:17.341 --> 00:20:18.926
Then, why did you admit to it?

00:20:19.009 --> 00:20:20.511
I didn't want it to blow up.

00:20:24.682 --> 00:20:27.893
It felt like the court was siding
with the other person anyway.

00:20:27.977 --> 00:20:30.229
So I just admitted it
to wrap things up quickly.

00:20:30.312 --> 00:20:32.356
I also had to get back to work.

00:20:36.569 --> 00:20:40.573
Mr. Park Kyunghyeon, are you a celebrity?
I'm not really familiar.

00:20:40.656 --> 00:20:42.074
No, not at all.

00:20:42.825 --> 00:20:43.826
No.

00:20:44.535 --> 00:20:45.953
I wouldn't say that.

00:20:47.079 --> 00:20:49.331
Then, what exactly were you afraid
would blow up?

00:20:50.082 --> 00:20:53.377
At the time, I was just scared.

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:56.756
I thought it over again
and realized this wasn't right.

00:20:56.839 --> 00:20:59.842
So I came here

00:21:00.551 --> 00:21:01.927
to reveal the truth.

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:05.347
Why else would I be here now?

00:21:06.432 --> 00:21:08.642
Just to get the truth out.

00:21:09.852 --> 00:21:11.187
Right, if you say so.

00:21:11.937 --> 00:21:13.522
How do you know the victim?

00:21:14.273 --> 00:21:15.274
Right…

00:21:16.776 --> 00:21:20.863
I'm a tax accountant.
He was a regular client.

00:21:21.614 --> 00:21:27.077
We got into a dispute over fees,
and he claimed I assaulted him.

00:21:27.161 --> 00:21:28.746
Did the fees change midway?

00:21:28.829 --> 00:21:29.872
No.

00:21:29.955 --> 00:21:32.917
That's just his side of the story.

00:21:49.141 --> 00:21:53.771
As you can see,
I don't get that many clients.

00:21:54.396 --> 00:21:57.066
So each one of them matters to me.

00:21:58.901 --> 00:22:02.613
Seriously, for what reason
would I ever hit my client?

00:22:07.159 --> 00:22:09.453
Okay, we'll proceed
with a not guilty plea for now.

00:22:09.537 --> 00:22:13.582
I'll get a copy of the evidence records
and be in touch after reviewing them.

00:22:17.628 --> 00:22:18.629
Is that it?

00:22:20.756 --> 00:22:21.757
Yes.

00:22:27.471 --> 00:22:28.556
How many people?

00:22:29.306 --> 00:22:30.683
Come this way.

00:22:30.766 --> 00:22:33.561
Come sit here. Please clear this table!

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:39.441
What is this, a funeral?

00:22:39.984 --> 00:22:40.985
Hey.

00:22:41.068 --> 00:22:42.987
Munjeong isn't here yet.

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:45.447
If we eat first,
we'll get yelled at again.

00:22:45.531 --> 00:22:46.574
Gosh.

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:54.331
- Welcome.
- Hello.

00:22:54.415 --> 00:22:55.875
- How many?
- I'm with a group.

00:22:55.958 --> 00:22:57.001
Okay.

00:22:59.295 --> 00:23:00.379
Let's eat.

00:23:00.462 --> 00:23:02.548
- Come on.
- Hurry up, will you?

00:23:02.631 --> 00:23:03.674
You make us look bad.

00:23:03.757 --> 00:23:06.010
- Ma'am, everyone's here!
- Okay.

00:23:06.093 --> 00:23:08.429
Hey, you were late
this morning too, right?

00:23:08.512 --> 00:23:10.264
I'm not you. I came back from court.

00:23:10.973 --> 00:23:13.058
- Really?
- How are you always late?

00:23:13.142 --> 00:23:15.352
Know how early I left?
I had a morning meeting--

00:23:15.436 --> 00:23:17.938
Technically, I don't think
it counts as being late.

00:23:18.022 --> 00:23:21.025
If clocking out has no set time,
why should clocking in have one?

00:23:21.108 --> 00:23:22.359
It's just a suggestion.

00:23:22.443 --> 00:23:25.321
And you guys don't clock in. It's just us.

00:23:25.404 --> 00:23:27.489
- Hey, they raised the price here.
- What?

00:23:31.368 --> 00:23:34.663
This one's over our budget too.
Where am I supposed to go now?

00:23:34.747 --> 00:23:37.625
Your firm's so cheap.
Is it still 8,000 won?

00:23:37.708 --> 00:23:40.502
If it's over budget,
put it on Dongwook's corporate card.

00:23:40.586 --> 00:23:43.380
- Hey, they notice when I use it.
- Use mine, then.

00:23:43.464 --> 00:23:44.715
You got a company card now?

00:23:44.798 --> 00:23:48.677
When I was there, they didn't cover meals.
Things have really improved.

00:23:48.761 --> 00:23:52.222
No, I meant I'll pay out of pocket.
My treat.

00:23:52.765 --> 00:23:54.224
It's not about money for me.

00:23:54.308 --> 00:23:55.476
Yeah, it is.

00:23:55.601 --> 00:23:57.478
- You're right.
- You're unbelievable.

00:23:57.561 --> 00:24:00.022
They offer more money,
so you jump ship upstairs?

00:24:00.105 --> 00:24:02.775
You should change jobs too
or open your own practice.

00:24:10.741 --> 00:24:12.576
Can we get more radish kimchi here?

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:14.954
Geez, getting your money's worth
with kimchi?

00:24:15.037 --> 00:24:17.581
- Finish this first.
- I'm going to finish it.

00:24:18.707 --> 00:24:21.126
Happy now?
More radish kimchi, please. We're out.

00:24:31.136 --> 00:24:32.346
I already want to go home.

00:24:36.809 --> 00:24:38.602
You're such an old man.

00:24:38.686 --> 00:24:39.937
Is that scorched rice tea?

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:41.021
Thank you.

00:24:41.105 --> 00:24:43.691
You're the weirdos with iced coffee
in this cold weather.

00:24:43.774 --> 00:24:45.025
You'll end up frozen stiff.

00:24:47.277 --> 00:24:48.529
What are you drinking?

00:24:49.029 --> 00:24:50.364
A strawberry yogurt smoothie.

00:24:50.447 --> 00:24:52.491
It really doesn't suit you.
Don't drink that.

00:24:52.574 --> 00:24:54.994
Don't force your coffee down.

00:24:55.077 --> 00:24:56.286
That's tricking your body.

00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:57.830
Should I call you old too?

00:24:59.498 --> 00:25:00.791
I just write it here?

00:25:00.874 --> 00:25:03.627
- What is he up to?
- What if they don't drop the charges?

00:25:03.711 --> 00:25:06.463
You have to trust me,
or we can't reach a deal!

00:25:06.547 --> 00:25:07.840
Gosh, it's so simple.

00:25:07.923 --> 00:25:10.134
You're doing it again. Just sit still.

00:25:10.217 --> 00:25:12.803
Everyone's an attorney here. Sit still.

00:25:12.886 --> 00:25:14.013
Hey, Changwon.

00:25:14.096 --> 00:25:17.307
I don't get how someone
this scatterbrained aced the CSAT.

00:25:17.391 --> 00:25:20.936
That's why I barely passed the bar
after using up all five tries.

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:23.480
Great job!
Our friend Changwon did so well--

00:25:26.025 --> 00:25:27.026
Chief.

00:25:28.152 --> 00:25:29.820
Yes, how are you?

00:25:29.903 --> 00:25:31.363
I hate that capitalist smile.

00:25:31.447 --> 00:25:34.366
Gosh, I should have called you first.
I'm sorry.

00:25:35.325 --> 00:25:37.703
Can a blind person even commit assault?

00:25:37.786 --> 00:25:41.290
They're capable of assault too.
Even murder.

00:25:42.416 --> 00:25:45.127
Is that being unbiased
or giving up on the defense?

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:48.047
Being visually impaired
doesn't mean you can't see anything.

00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:51.341
They can perceive lights,
and most can make out shapes.

00:25:51.425 --> 00:25:52.968
That's why we're writing this!

00:25:54.011 --> 00:25:56.138
Come on. Let's just go, okay?

00:25:56.638 --> 00:25:57.639
But…

00:25:58.265 --> 00:26:00.559
By the way,
no one forgot about tonight, right?

00:26:00.642 --> 00:26:03.020
- Yeah.
- I have a blind date. Can I be late?

00:26:03.103 --> 00:26:04.563
- Again?
- You need to stop.

00:26:04.646 --> 00:26:07.107
- What time is it?
- It's at 6:30 p.m.

00:26:07.191 --> 00:26:09.151
Then, let's meet at 8 p.m. Okay?

00:26:09.234 --> 00:26:11.028
It'll only take an hour or two, right?

00:26:11.695 --> 00:26:12.738
Well…

00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:15.491
If I like her, I might stay longer.

00:26:22.039 --> 00:26:23.665
What? What is it?

00:26:24.333 --> 00:26:26.085
Sure, that's possible.

00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:28.378
What are you all laughing?

00:26:29.588 --> 00:26:30.881
You were about to laugh too.

00:26:30.964 --> 00:26:31.965
Hey, you want to bet?

00:26:32.049 --> 00:26:34.343
Ten thousand won says
he won't like his date again.

00:26:34.426 --> 00:26:35.969
- I'll bet for that too.
- Me too.

00:26:36.053 --> 00:26:37.805
Come on. That's not a bet, then.

00:26:37.888 --> 00:26:39.556
I'll go all in on "He likes her."

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:40.849
Beat the odds to win big.

00:26:40.933 --> 00:26:43.185
There she goes again,
like a moth to the flame.

00:26:43.268 --> 00:26:44.770
Seriously,

00:26:44.853 --> 00:26:47.481
you always dislike your blind dates,
so why keep going?

00:26:47.564 --> 00:26:48.732
From what I see,

00:26:48.816 --> 00:26:51.568
your success rate is lower
than the lottery.

00:26:51.652 --> 00:26:54.655
At least with the lottery, someone wins.

00:26:55.489 --> 00:26:58.033
You could meet someone
you're destined to be with.

00:27:02.788 --> 00:27:04.206
- Geez.
- Hey.

00:27:04.289 --> 00:27:08.127
That's the funniest thing
you've said this year. No, ever.

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:10.754
Crazy bastard.
Destiny? That's so not like you.

00:27:10.838 --> 00:27:12.464
You've had that experience before?

00:27:12.548 --> 00:27:13.882
Yeah, once.

00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:18.053
- Well, it wasn't a blind date.
- Not a blind date? Then what?

00:27:18.137 --> 00:27:19.346
- Well…
- A dream!

00:27:22.641 --> 00:27:23.851
DEFENDANT: PARK KYUNGHYEON

00:27:23.934 --> 00:27:26.603
There's also an audio recording.
I put it on a USB drive.

00:27:26.687 --> 00:27:28.480
Okay. Thank you for your help.

00:27:43.579 --> 00:27:45.372
Appeals.

00:27:52.588 --> 00:27:54.089
WRITTEN ACCUSATION
KIM SEUNGKOOK

00:28:00.721 --> 00:28:03.849
AUDIO RECORDING FILE, KIM SEUNGKOOK

00:28:03.932 --> 00:28:05.642
{\an8}"Audio recording file."

00:28:14.568 --> 00:28:16.361
{\an8}You're going to hit someone over money?

00:28:16.445 --> 00:28:18.488
{\an8}Stop talking nonsense!

00:28:20.198 --> 00:28:21.617
You can't do this to me!

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:23.035
Kim Seungkook!

00:28:23.785 --> 00:28:25.913
What are you trying to pull, Seungkook?

00:28:31.877 --> 00:28:33.670
- Come on!
- Since I'm a regular,

00:28:33.754 --> 00:28:37.049
I gently asked if he could give me
a small discount that day.

00:28:37.132 --> 00:28:40.260
But he suddenly lost it
and started throwing things everywhere.

00:28:40.344 --> 00:28:43.138
Come on, is it that hard
to knock a little off the fee?

00:28:43.221 --> 00:28:45.807
Why do you keep messing with me?

00:28:49.394 --> 00:28:52.773
I instinctively tried to call for help,
but my phone didn't work.

00:28:54.316 --> 00:28:56.401
So I ran to the landline in the office

00:28:56.485 --> 00:28:58.570
and picked up the receiver
to call the police,

00:28:59.321 --> 00:29:01.698
but he threw it away.

00:29:03.867 --> 00:29:06.328
{\an8}It turns out the call didn't go through

00:29:06.995 --> 00:29:09.665
{\an8}because I hit the record button
by mistake.

00:29:10.499 --> 00:29:11.625
Let go of me!

00:29:22.844 --> 00:29:25.430
The truth is, I didn't do it.

00:29:25.514 --> 00:29:28.350
I thought it over again
and realized this wasn't right.

00:29:28.433 --> 00:29:31.520
So I came here to reveal the truth.

00:29:34.523 --> 00:29:37.693
Man, now that means
I have to go there.

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:41.905
I guess I'll have to go.

00:29:42.823 --> 00:29:44.449
Geez, let's go.

00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:51.748
Bus number 541.

00:29:53.375 --> 00:29:55.919

{\an8}OFFICE OF TAX ACCOUNTANT PARK KYUNGHYEON

00:30:57.731 --> 00:30:58.774
Come in.

00:30:58.857 --> 00:31:00.901
Thank you. I got here a little early.

00:31:15.207 --> 00:31:18.502
ON-SITE PHOTOGRAPH

00:31:18.585 --> 00:31:20.670
The interior looks totally different now.

00:31:22.547 --> 00:31:23.715
Yes.

00:31:24.424 --> 00:31:26.760
A friend said it'd make me feel better,

00:31:26.843 --> 00:31:28.887
so they changed it for me.

00:31:29.387 --> 00:31:30.764
But honestly, I wouldn't know.

00:31:31.389 --> 00:31:32.390
Right.

00:31:34.101 --> 00:31:35.393
I'll sit on the couch.

00:31:35.477 --> 00:31:36.478
Okay.

00:31:55.413 --> 00:31:56.873
You put it right in front of me.

00:31:58.917 --> 00:32:02.504
I have this place mapped out in my head.

00:32:02.587 --> 00:32:03.588
I see.

00:32:10.846 --> 00:32:12.347
I've seen all the evidence.

00:32:13.098 --> 00:32:16.184
Even if you claimed innocence,
you would've been found guilty.

00:32:16.768 --> 00:32:18.311
What kind of evidence was there?

00:32:20.188 --> 00:32:22.816
The broken items, the on-site photos,

00:32:22.899 --> 00:32:25.861
photos of the injuries,
and a recording from the assault.

00:32:25.944 --> 00:32:29.489
The photos and recordings were consistent
with the victim's account.

00:32:29.573 --> 00:32:30.574
I see.

00:32:31.241 --> 00:32:33.243
Just as I thought,
he was recording it.

00:32:35.078 --> 00:32:36.705
You spoke casually with each other.

00:32:38.415 --> 00:32:39.416
Yes.

00:32:41.001 --> 00:32:42.794
He was a regular and…

00:32:43.295 --> 00:32:45.422
we were the same age,
so we kept things casual.

00:32:45.505 --> 00:32:48.466
That recording could've been
interpreted a certain way.

00:32:49.092 --> 00:32:51.720
It seemed like
he was breaking things by himself,

00:32:51.803 --> 00:32:55.682
and he was saying strange things,
as if I was doing something to him.

00:32:55.765 --> 00:32:59.603
It even sounded like
he was hitting himself.

00:33:00.478 --> 00:33:03.064
Are you saying Mr. Kim
staged all of that by himself?

00:33:03.148 --> 00:33:04.149
Yes.

00:33:04.649 --> 00:33:06.234
He kept saying weird things,

00:33:06.318 --> 00:33:08.528
so I told him
to stop saying nonsense.

00:33:08.612 --> 00:33:11.489
I admit I did push him.

00:33:14.117 --> 00:33:16.328
Then, why didn't you mention that
this morning?

00:33:16.953 --> 00:33:18.455
Did you make an effort to listen?

00:33:21.958 --> 00:33:23.251
About half a year ago,

00:33:23.335 --> 00:33:26.713
he kept saying he was drowning
in money issues.

00:33:26.796 --> 00:33:30.842
From what I saw when I filed his taxes,
his situation didn't look good.

00:33:30.926 --> 00:33:34.763
Then, Mr. Kim asking for a fee reduction
seems understandable.

00:33:35.347 --> 00:33:38.600
Not at all. Well…

00:33:40.101 --> 00:33:42.479
He never said anything like that.
Actually, that day…

00:33:45.523 --> 00:33:47.275
he wasn't here for tax business.

00:33:50.111 --> 00:33:55.492
You're saying Mr. Kim came here,
staged an assault, and recorded it?

00:33:55.575 --> 00:33:56.576
Yes, that's right.

00:33:59.621 --> 00:34:01.831
I have no reason to beat him up.

00:34:10.298 --> 00:34:11.675
It's 6:00 p.m.

00:34:13.176 --> 00:34:17.597
I'm on blood pressure medication.
I'm sorry. Give me one second.

00:34:18.306 --> 00:34:19.307
Okay.

00:34:36.283 --> 00:34:38.201
May I use the restroom?

00:34:39.035 --> 00:34:41.037
Yes, of course.

00:34:46.418 --> 00:34:50.088
The restroom is here. Feel free to use it.

00:34:55.302 --> 00:34:56.511
Okay, thank you.

00:35:16.698 --> 00:35:18.366
Where do we start?

00:35:18.450 --> 00:35:20.201
We start, then just keep going.

00:35:20.285 --> 00:35:22.245
- So…
- I'm a little…

00:35:22.329 --> 00:35:24.205
But we have to drink what Dongwook wants.

00:35:24.289 --> 00:35:25.498
You're down 900 million.

00:35:25.582 --> 00:35:26.916
- Not bad.
- I got hooked.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.044
It doesn't mean
I should drink it with you.

00:35:29.127 --> 00:35:30.670
- If you call…
- It's your last day.

00:35:30.754 --> 00:35:33.381
I'm saying you should buy the whiskey.
It's not our money.

00:35:34.633 --> 00:35:36.134
Juhyeong might be a bit late.

00:35:36.217 --> 00:35:37.218
- Really?
- What?

00:35:37.302 --> 00:35:39.554
"I'm going to be a bit late."

00:35:39.638 --> 00:35:40.680
What?

00:35:40.764 --> 00:35:42.265
- What?
- He must've liked his date.

00:35:42.349 --> 00:35:43.642
- Is he in trouble?
- Really?

00:35:43.725 --> 00:35:44.726
I'll text him.

00:35:44.809 --> 00:35:46.645
- Is he traveling far?
- Is this possible?

00:35:49.606 --> 00:35:50.940
I had so much fun today.

00:35:51.024 --> 00:35:52.233
Me too.

00:35:52.817 --> 00:35:54.110
We didn't get to talk much.

00:35:54.694 --> 00:35:55.904
It's such a shame.

00:35:55.987 --> 00:35:58.406
Yeah. I'll be in touch again.

00:35:58.490 --> 00:36:01.576
- Yes, please make sure you do.
- Okay.

00:36:16.549 --> 00:36:20.053
LEE JEONGMIN, INTRODUCED BY KIBEOM

00:36:20.136 --> 00:36:22.472
DELETE CONTACT

00:36:34.567 --> 00:36:36.820
It looks delicious.

00:36:39.197 --> 00:36:40.365
This is fancy food.

00:36:40.949 --> 00:36:42.283
It'll boost my blog views.

00:36:42.367 --> 00:36:43.451
- Good.
- That's enough.

00:36:43.535 --> 00:36:46.079
Turn it a little bit more like this. Okay.

00:36:46.162 --> 00:36:47.580
- That's enough!
- Okay.

00:36:47.664 --> 00:36:49.749
Still blogging? Was it "A Lawyer's Table?"

00:36:49.833 --> 00:36:51.292
- Yeah.
- Wait.

00:36:51.376 --> 00:36:55.088
You're such an old man. No one blogs now.
People post on social media.

00:36:55.171 --> 00:36:57.924
Still, these sponsorships pay pretty well.

00:36:58.007 --> 00:37:00.885
At best,
you just get a free meal out of it.

00:37:00.969 --> 00:37:02.721
And always in boring Seocho-dong.

00:37:02.804 --> 00:37:04.097
It's better than nothing.

00:37:04.681 --> 00:37:06.933
- Are you done? Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

00:37:08.101 --> 00:37:09.144
What?

00:37:12.856 --> 00:37:14.315
- What's going on?
- What?

00:37:15.483 --> 00:37:17.652
- How was it?
- You said you might be late.

00:37:17.736 --> 00:37:18.737
Yeah, I'm late.

00:37:19.571 --> 00:37:20.572
It's 8:03 p.m.

00:37:21.239 --> 00:37:22.490
How was the blind date?

00:37:23.616 --> 00:37:25.702
- Damn it.
- Yes!

00:37:26.411 --> 00:37:30.123
All right, I'll send you each 13,300 won.

00:37:30.206 --> 00:37:31.624
Hey!

00:37:31.708 --> 00:37:33.334
Why is it short by 100 won?

00:37:34.252 --> 00:37:36.212
The transfer fee. I'm the one sending it.

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:38.465
- Geez.
- Hey.

00:37:38.548 --> 00:37:41.509
If it was bad, you should've rushed over.
Why are you so late?

00:37:41.593 --> 00:37:44.429
- This dinner's not even for you.
- It's okay.

00:37:44.512 --> 00:37:46.723
Forget it.
Just raise your glasses for a toast.

00:37:46.806 --> 00:37:51.060
- No need for a toast. Let's just drink.
- Quitting's worth a toast. Cheers!

00:37:51.144 --> 00:37:53.188
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:37:54.564 --> 00:37:56.024
The shrimp toast is famous here.

00:37:56.858 --> 00:37:59.277
Check out the octopus.
Whose idea was it to come here?

00:37:59.986 --> 00:38:03.698
- That's why I suggested coming here.
- Good call. The texture is amazing.

00:38:05.492 --> 00:38:07.243
How long have you worked here?

00:38:08.036 --> 00:38:09.245
Just over a year.

00:38:09.954 --> 00:38:10.997
You've hit 10 years?

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:15.084
You keep adding a year every time.
It's eight full years. This is my ninth.

00:38:15.168 --> 00:38:17.504
Nearly 10 years in one place? That's wild.

00:38:18.087 --> 00:38:19.589
It's my ninth year, okay?

00:38:19.672 --> 00:38:20.673
Ninth year.

00:38:20.757 --> 00:38:23.468
You should open your own firm.
You've been here too long.

00:38:23.551 --> 00:38:26.221
If you're still here next year,
I'm telling the news.

00:38:26.304 --> 00:38:28.056
"Stuck as an associate for 10 years."

00:38:28.139 --> 00:38:31.726
Opening a firm's a hassle.
She was my classmate and she won't do it.

00:38:31.810 --> 00:38:36.189
{\an8}Hey, I passed the bar a year after you,
and I'm new to litigation.

00:38:36.272 --> 00:38:38.733
{\an8}I did public office
and in-house counsel work.

00:38:38.817 --> 00:38:40.568
Why'd you switch to litigation again?

00:38:40.652 --> 00:38:43.446
I'm just not cut out for corporate life.

00:38:43.530 --> 00:38:45.448
Anyone can see
you're not cut out for that.

00:38:45.532 --> 00:38:47.242
It took you four years to realize?

00:38:48.034 --> 00:38:51.371
Is opening your own firm
that much of a hassle for you?

00:38:51.454 --> 00:38:52.831
Of course. Isn't it for you?

00:38:52.914 --> 00:38:54.958
You're literally starting from scratch.

00:38:55.041 --> 00:38:56.918
And you could go broke too.

00:38:57.001 --> 00:39:01.047
You hate taking orders, right?
Why not just do what you want?

00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:03.591
If I start my own firm,
who's going to hand me cases?

00:39:03.675 --> 00:39:06.135
I'd have to take whatever.
Beggars can't be choosers.

00:39:06.219 --> 00:39:11.432
At least you could turn down
what you would really hate doing.

00:39:11.516 --> 00:39:14.894
Just doing what I'm told is easier.

00:39:15.436 --> 00:39:17.772
I've finally got the hang of things.

00:39:17.856 --> 00:39:19.649
Paychecks come in on time too.

00:39:20.441 --> 00:39:22.777
So it's kind of like…

00:39:38.585 --> 00:39:40.336
- Look out!
- Hurry up!

00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:41.421
Hurry!

00:39:43.131 --> 00:39:44.340
Run!

00:40:13.494 --> 00:40:16.247
All right, time to wrap up life
as an associate

00:40:16.915 --> 00:40:18.166
and open your own firm.

00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:21.461
Hurry!

00:40:24.505 --> 00:40:27.175
Come on, move it! Hurry!

00:40:31.095 --> 00:40:32.263
I don't want to.

00:40:39.062 --> 00:40:40.229
"I don't want to?" What?

00:40:40.313 --> 00:40:42.482
That's not the point. Bombs are going off.

00:40:42.565 --> 00:40:44.525
You thought it was war,
but it was a drill.

00:40:44.609 --> 00:40:47.111
- And you're wearing a padded coat?
- You never served.

00:40:47.195 --> 00:40:49.614
It feels like that story
changes every year.

00:40:49.697 --> 00:40:52.784
You touched it up again.
It makes even less sense.

00:40:52.867 --> 00:40:56.120
It's just a metaphor.
What will you do after quitting?

00:40:56.204 --> 00:40:59.707
I'm taking a break first.
I'll try to figure out what to do next.

00:41:00.291 --> 00:41:03.127
Let's say you get a one-month break.
What would you do?

00:41:04.712 --> 00:41:05.713
What would I do?

00:41:05.797 --> 00:41:07.840
- Firstly, I'll…
- If you rest for a month,

00:41:07.924 --> 00:41:09.884
it's hard to work again.
I'll take a week.

00:41:09.968 --> 00:41:11.260
Don't be a buzzkill. Geez.

00:41:11.344 --> 00:41:12.679
First, I'd go overseas.

00:41:12.762 --> 00:41:14.764
Is it paid or unpaid leave?

00:41:14.847 --> 00:41:20.395
I'm using the time to plan my next step,
so I have no time for travel.

00:41:20.478 --> 00:41:21.479
Shut up!

00:41:22.188 --> 00:41:23.564
Way to ruin the mood.

00:41:23.648 --> 00:41:25.191
Don't go then, you psychos.

00:41:25.274 --> 00:41:27.527
It's not ruined for me.
Ask me what I'd do. I'd--

00:41:27.610 --> 00:41:30.029
Did they hire someone
to take your spot yet?

00:41:30.113 --> 00:41:32.907
No, but I heard
they're interviewing someone tomorrow.

00:41:32.991 --> 00:41:35.702
It's been hard finding someone,
so I left a handover file.

00:41:35.785 --> 00:41:37.161
I put all your numbers.

00:41:38.287 --> 00:41:40.832
You'll have a lot of free time.
Come visit us sometime.

00:41:40.915 --> 00:41:42.667
Sure. Let's all have a drink.

00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:43.876
Sounds good.

00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:45.878
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:41:45.962 --> 00:41:47.005
Congratulations!

00:41:50.425 --> 00:41:52.719
First, I'd head overseas.

00:41:52.802 --> 00:41:54.762
To Banff, Canada. Ever heard of it?

00:41:54.846 --> 00:41:56.723
If no one wants this, I'm taking it.

00:41:56.806 --> 00:41:58.266
- I want it.
- With who?

00:41:58.349 --> 00:41:59.600
- The Rocky Mountains.
- Who?

00:41:59.684 --> 00:42:01.144
It's untouched though.

00:42:01.227 --> 00:42:03.229
- Who am I talking to?
- Go with who?

00:42:03.312 --> 00:42:04.397
That's not important.

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:06.274
- Eat all of this.
- The Rocky Mountains…

00:42:22.874 --> 00:42:24.751
Gosh, I feel queasy.

00:42:24.834 --> 00:42:26.127
- Hey.
- Yeah?

00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:29.464
- Geez.
- Do you smell alcohol?

00:42:29.964 --> 00:42:31.090
Yeah, obviously.

00:42:31.591 --> 00:42:33.551
Hey, did you see this?

00:42:35.678 --> 00:42:36.679
What?

00:42:36.763 --> 00:42:38.306
Dongwook left the group text?

00:42:38.389 --> 00:42:40.892
Yeah. I even texted him
to check if he got home okay.

00:42:40.975 --> 00:42:42.018
He didn't read it.

00:42:42.101 --> 00:42:44.562
Seriously?
He said we'd hang out soon just yesterday.

00:42:44.645 --> 00:42:46.147
I told him to leave the group.

00:42:47.315 --> 00:42:49.275
- Why would you?
- It's a lunch group text.

00:42:49.358 --> 00:42:51.027
It would've been weird if he stayed.

00:42:51.527 --> 00:42:54.572
It'd be annoying to hear things
you're out of the loop on.

00:42:54.655 --> 00:42:56.866
Still, that's not the point, man.

00:42:56.949 --> 00:43:00.995
If someone's gone, why keep them around?
He'd already checked out anyway.

00:43:01.079 --> 00:43:02.914
You're really cold, you know that?

00:43:05.041 --> 00:43:06.250
We passed the 5th floor.

00:43:06.751 --> 00:43:08.419
I told you to press my floor too.

00:43:08.503 --> 00:43:10.838
Just get off and walk.
It's good for your health.

00:43:10.922 --> 00:43:12.715
Then, you walk from the 5th floor.

00:43:12.799 --> 00:43:13.800

It's cold.

00:44:38.759 --> 00:44:40.011
Thanks.

00:44:40.094 --> 00:44:41.429

- Bye.

LAW GROUP CHUNGGONG

00:45:35.149 --> 00:45:36.609
Attorney Kang Huiji?

00:45:36.692 --> 00:45:37.693
Yes.

00:45:39.654 --> 00:45:42.657
It's only been seven months,
including your training period.

00:45:43.241 --> 00:45:45.243
Any reason for changing jobs already?

00:45:46.244 --> 00:45:48.287
It was very repetitive work.

00:45:48.371 --> 00:45:50.414
I felt like
I wasn't learning anything new.

00:45:50.498 --> 00:45:51.749
I've already quit my job.

00:45:52.333 --> 00:45:55.253
So you quit before finding a new job?

00:45:56.295 --> 00:45:59.674
I didn't want to stay and get paid
for work I wasn't fully invested in.

00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:01.884
That's nice.

00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:05.471
Just so you know,
it'll be only you and I working here.

00:46:05.554 --> 00:46:08.307
- Are you okay with that?
- Yes.

00:46:08.975 --> 00:46:11.811
I'd actually prefer being more hands-on.

00:46:16.482 --> 00:46:18.943
All right. Let's give it a shot.

00:46:20.611 --> 00:46:22.363
Is that it?

00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:24.031
Yes.

00:46:26.993 --> 00:46:30.037
If it's okay,
can I ask you just one thing?

00:46:30.121 --> 00:46:31.122
Of course.

00:46:31.872 --> 00:46:34.166
Why did you become a lawyer?

00:46:38.296 --> 00:46:41.132
- Was that out of line? I'm sorry.
- No, not at all.

00:46:41.882 --> 00:46:42.883
Good question.

00:46:45.344 --> 00:46:46.971
Why did I become a lawyer?

00:46:48.681 --> 00:46:53.060
I wanted to take matters into my own hands
and fix the problems around me.

00:46:55.062 --> 00:46:58.232
Are you able to do that now?

00:46:59.025 --> 00:47:00.109
Yes.

00:47:03.946 --> 00:47:05.698
Did you like my answer?

00:47:05.781 --> 00:47:08.117
Yes. Even more than I expected.

00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:09.243
That's good to hear.

00:47:10.286 --> 00:47:12.788
So, when can you start?

00:47:12.872 --> 00:47:13.998
I can start now.

00:47:14.874 --> 00:47:16.042
Now?

00:47:17.084 --> 00:47:19.587
If it's too much pressure,
should I start tomorrow?

00:47:20.171 --> 00:47:21.630
I mean, I like it here,

00:47:21.714 --> 00:47:23.966
and it seems like you like me too.

00:47:24.925 --> 00:47:29.138
If it's okay for me to step out later
for one last hearing on an old case,

00:47:29.221 --> 00:47:30.765
I can start today.

00:47:33.017 --> 00:47:35.853
All right. Great. You can start now.

00:47:35.936 --> 00:47:36.979
Yes, thank you.

00:47:37.063 --> 00:47:39.398
But you're going to a hearing?

00:47:40.066 --> 00:47:42.818
You know lawyers don't usually
show up for that, right?

00:47:42.902 --> 00:47:43.944
Yes, I know.

00:47:44.737 --> 00:47:48.199
But it's my first hearing.
And I made a promise.

00:47:48.282 --> 00:47:49.784
All right, sounds good.

00:47:51.118 --> 00:47:52.912
I'd like to ask the same question.

00:47:54.246 --> 00:47:57.625
What made you want to
become a lawyer?

00:48:02.171 --> 00:48:05.049
- You can use this room.
- Okay, thank you.

I'll introduce you to the other attorneys.

Hello, I'm Attorney Kang Huiji.

00:49:32.970 --> 00:49:34.263
Hello.

00:49:34.346 --> 00:49:36.474
This is our new associate attorney.

00:49:36.557 --> 00:49:38.601
- I see. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

00:49:42.229 --> 00:49:43.397
I'm sure you know,

00:49:43.481 --> 00:49:47.109
{\an8}but the partners operate
separately from us.

00:49:47.193 --> 00:49:48.861
{\an8}We don't really collaborate,

00:49:48.944 --> 00:49:51.489
- so a quick hello is enough.
- Okay.

00:49:52.406 --> 00:49:53.949

Who?

00:50:03.375 --> 00:50:05.211
I've never even heard of them.

00:50:06.545 --> 00:50:07.796
Who are they?

00:50:11.926 --> 00:50:13.928
Never mind, I must be mistaken.

Ask Bae Munjeong for good restaurants.

Ask Attorney Ha Sanggi
for savings accounts,

retirement plans, and tax deductions.

00:50:44.333 --> 00:50:47.419

What are you doing?

- Help me.
- It sounded like he was hitting himself.

00:52:30.939 --> 00:52:32.816
What are you trying to pull?

00:52:33.692 --> 00:52:35.277
He kept saying weird things,

00:52:35.361 --> 00:52:37.655
so I told him
to stop saying nonsense.

00:52:37.738 --> 00:52:40.324
I admit I did push him.

KIM SEUNGKOOK

00:54:04.616 --> 00:54:07.119
We knew we'd drink a lot last night.

00:54:08.537 --> 00:54:12.040
So obviously, today's lunch
would be bean sprout soup.

00:54:12.750 --> 00:54:16.211
Why did we have this yesterday
for lunch too?

00:54:17.379 --> 00:54:19.715
- Right? Are we dumb?
- I knew.

00:54:20.716 --> 00:54:22.593
Then, you should've said something.

00:54:22.676 --> 00:54:24.553
"Let's eat it tomorrow and not today."

00:54:24.636 --> 00:54:26.680
I'm fine eating the same thing twice.

00:54:26.764 --> 00:54:28.974
So annoying. You could've said something.

00:54:29.057 --> 00:54:30.434
- About what?
- You little…

00:54:32.019 --> 00:54:33.020
Never mind.

00:54:42.362 --> 00:54:44.865
When is Dongwook being replaced?
He left our numbers.

00:54:44.948 --> 00:54:47.618
She reached out to me.
It seems she started today.

00:54:47.701 --> 00:54:48.869
- What?
- Right away?

00:54:48.952 --> 00:54:51.497
- Yeah.
- I thought the interview was today.

00:54:51.580 --> 00:54:53.040
She must've been desperate.

00:54:53.123 --> 00:54:55.876
- Desperate for money?
- Find out for yourself later.

00:54:55.959 --> 00:54:57.586
She's joining us for dinner.

00:54:57.669 --> 00:54:59.171
I'm seeing my girlfriend tonight.

00:54:59.254 --> 00:55:01.215
- Which girlfriend?
- The other day,

00:55:01.298 --> 00:55:03.759
I passed a gorgeous girl
at Gangnam Station.

00:55:03.842 --> 00:55:05.719
He's not serious.
He was messing with you.

00:55:05.802 --> 00:55:07.763
I know. But I still have to answer him.

00:55:07.846 --> 00:55:10.432
Then, how about
we have dinner on our own

00:55:10.516 --> 00:55:13.060
and grab a quick beer later?

00:55:13.143 --> 00:55:14.603
A quick beer? Sounds good.

00:55:15.354 --> 00:55:17.397
After last night, you want to drink again?

00:55:18.524 --> 00:55:20.567
Then, don't drink!

00:55:20.651 --> 00:55:22.819
Don't even think about taking one sip.

00:55:22.903 --> 00:55:25.614
You'll end up drinking anyway.
All you do is nag.

00:55:26.698 --> 00:55:28.867
If we fought,
would you pretend not to know me?

00:55:28.951 --> 00:55:30.702
He's changing the subject again.

00:55:30.786 --> 00:55:32.579
- Is this that big of a deal?
- No.

00:55:34.498 --> 00:55:36.875
Do you pretend not to know your exes too?

00:55:37.584 --> 00:55:38.961
I don't think so.

00:55:39.044 --> 00:55:42.464
Hey, I have boundaries too, okay?
I don't talk to my exes.

00:55:43.173 --> 00:55:44.174
Right?

00:55:44.967 --> 00:55:46.301
Anyway, like I was saying…

00:55:46.385 --> 00:55:47.594
After I broke up--

00:55:47.678 --> 00:55:48.929
- You're too loud.
- Loud?

00:55:49.012 --> 00:55:50.889
- I just started talking.
- It's still loud.

00:55:51.515 --> 00:55:52.599
I'll keep it down.

00:55:52.683 --> 00:55:54.393
- After I broke up--
- Stop.

00:55:54.935 --> 00:55:56.520
Forget it. I'll stop talking.

00:55:59.773 --> 00:56:04.861
Civil case number 2022-4890.

00:56:04.945 --> 00:56:08.532
Plaintiff, Lee Imja.
Defendant, Jeong Iseul.

00:56:08.615 --> 00:56:09.825
Absent, I presume?

00:56:10.742 --> 00:56:13.912
The plaintiff's claim is dismissed.

00:56:13.996 --> 00:56:16.790
The plaintiff shall bear the costs.

00:56:18.584 --> 00:56:23.463
Civil case number 2023-34120.

00:56:23.547 --> 00:56:27.175
Plaintiff, Bimyeong Inc.
Defendant, Lee Garam.

00:56:27.259 --> 00:56:28.302
Absent, I presume?

00:56:28.885 --> 00:56:32.180
This case shall be dismissed.

00:56:32.264 --> 00:56:35.142
The plaintiff shall bear the costs.

00:56:35.851 --> 00:56:40.772
Civil case number 2024-59302.

00:56:40.856 --> 00:56:43.942
Plaintiff, Kim Mikyeong.
Defendant, Kim Naeun.

00:56:44.026 --> 00:56:45.527
Absent, I presume?

00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:50.198
Who is present?

00:56:50.782 --> 00:56:52.200
Defendant, Kim Naeun.

00:56:52.951 --> 00:56:55.495
Is the person next to you the plaintiff?

00:56:56.163 --> 00:56:57.497
I'm her lawyer.

00:56:59.041 --> 00:57:00.125
I see.

00:57:01.084 --> 00:57:02.669
Her lawyer?

00:57:02.753 --> 00:57:03.920
Yes.

00:57:04.504 --> 00:57:07.132
My goodness. I was so nervous.

00:57:07.883 --> 00:57:11.637
So, I promised I'd come with you
and that the ruling would go well.

00:57:12.262 --> 00:57:13.263
Thank you so much.

00:57:13.805 --> 00:57:15.682
Actually, I was worried.

00:57:15.766 --> 00:57:18.518
- You were? I told you not to worry.
- Attorney Kang!

00:57:19.144 --> 00:57:20.145
Hello, ma'am.

00:57:20.937 --> 00:57:23.940
Wait, your hearing
was at Central District?

00:57:24.024 --> 00:57:26.985
Yes, are you here for your trial too?

00:57:27.903 --> 00:57:30.197
Say hello.
She's the CEO of my new law firm.

00:57:31.198 --> 00:57:32.282
Hello.

00:57:32.366 --> 00:57:33.492
Yes, hello.

00:57:34.076 --> 00:57:37.621
You two go way back?
That's why you went to the hearing?

00:57:38.205 --> 00:57:40.957
Actually, we didn't know
each other before.

00:57:41.041 --> 00:57:43.085
We got closer through the case.

00:57:44.294 --> 00:57:46.672
So she was just your client?

00:57:47.339 --> 00:57:49.299
- Yes.
- I see.

00:57:49.383 --> 00:57:51.677
I'll head back to the office first.

00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:53.220
Okay.

00:57:53.303 --> 00:57:54.304
See you later.

00:58:10.570 --> 00:58:12.948
You're early.
We still have a bit of time.

00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:14.908
Yes.

00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:18.662
Here's what you asked for.

00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:25.961
Yes, that's right.

00:58:29.965 --> 00:58:32.592
I've read through the complaint
that Mr. Kim filed.

00:58:33.260 --> 00:58:36.304
Normally, the address on the cover page
is redacted.

00:58:36.388 --> 00:58:39.307
It seems the prosecution made a mistake.
It was fully visible.

00:58:42.144 --> 00:58:43.729
I see.

00:58:47.566 --> 00:58:51.027
In front of you, I've placed the cover
of Mr. Kim's complaint

00:58:51.111 --> 00:58:53.113
and your resident certificate.

00:58:59.453 --> 00:59:02.038
I don't assume
that being visually impaired

00:59:02.122 --> 00:59:04.958
means you couldn't have hit Mr. Kim.

00:59:05.959 --> 00:59:09.337
Assuming the blind can't commit assault
could be a form of bias.

00:59:10.130 --> 00:59:12.215
That's not what my attorney
should be saying.

00:59:14.509 --> 00:59:16.386
I've thought a lot about how to interpret

00:59:16.470 --> 00:59:18.597
the fact that you two
have the same address.

00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:20.515
257, GIREUM-RO 8-GIL, SEONGBUK-GU, SEOUL

00:59:22.768 --> 00:59:25.020
257, GIREUM-RO 8-GIL, SEONGBUK-GU, SEOUL

00:59:37.407 --> 00:59:40.160
Even assuming you two were just roommates

00:59:40.243 --> 00:59:43.079
would've been a form of bias too.

00:59:43.163 --> 00:59:46.374
- Isn't it cold?
- Yeah, the traffic was really bad.

00:59:47.209 --> 00:59:49.628
- Wait, what's that smell?
- I made something good.

00:59:50.462 --> 00:59:52.464
You lived together but now live apart.

00:59:52.547 --> 00:59:55.300
If you're hiding your relationship
after all this trouble…

00:59:55.383 --> 00:59:56.718
Spoon.

00:59:58.053 --> 00:59:59.721
…the most natural conclusion is that

00:59:59.805 --> 01:00:02.432
you were dating and then broke up.

01:00:07.187 --> 01:00:09.272
Yes, that's right. We were together.

01:00:09.356 --> 01:00:10.816
It's true that we've broken up.

01:00:11.358 --> 01:00:13.610
I wasn't trying to hide it on purpose.
I'm sorry.

01:00:13.693 --> 01:00:15.111
No, you were trying to hide it.

01:00:15.946 --> 01:00:19.658
If there was violence after a breakup,
that's motive. Classic domestic abuse.

01:00:19.741 --> 01:00:21.701
Did you hit Mr. Kim
because he ended things?

01:00:21.785 --> 01:00:22.786
I didn't hit him!

01:00:27.874 --> 01:00:31.419
He's doing all this because I ended it.

01:00:34.464 --> 01:00:37.050
Let me be more specific.

01:00:37.133 --> 01:00:40.720
It's because I asked him to pay back
the money I lent him

01:00:40.804 --> 01:00:42.180
while we were still together.

01:00:42.264 --> 01:00:44.432
But I'm guessing
you don't have that in writing.

01:00:44.516 --> 01:00:47.477
No. I wasn't planning to ask for it back.

01:00:48.103 --> 01:00:52.065
I was staying at his place,
and it felt like I was just covering rent.

01:00:52.148 --> 01:00:54.484
But soon, it kept piling up.

01:00:54.568 --> 01:00:56.903
Why should I have to pay that back?

01:00:56.987 --> 01:00:59.364
If you keep this up,
I'll have no other choice.

01:01:01.741 --> 01:01:03.243
Yes, the story sounds real now.

01:01:03.326 --> 01:01:05.120
It makes sense with plenty of motive.

01:01:05.203 --> 01:01:08.290
No, that's exactly what happened.
I have the bank records.

01:01:08.874 --> 01:01:09.916
If that's the truth,

01:01:10.542 --> 01:01:12.294
you'd have said that from the start.

01:01:21.052 --> 01:01:23.597
But that would mean outing ourselves.

01:01:28.268 --> 01:01:30.896
I've already come out.
But Seungkook hasn't.

01:01:42.115 --> 01:01:46.036
You just went along with it
out of consideration for Mr. Kim?

01:01:48.288 --> 01:01:49.956
Yes, that's right.

01:01:56.004 --> 01:01:57.339
But you appealed, didn't you?

01:02:00.216 --> 01:02:01.968
If you hadn't appealed, like you said,

01:02:02.052 --> 01:02:04.220
it would've ended
with a suspended sentence.

01:02:04.304 --> 01:02:07.098
There would've been no need
to reveal Mr. Kim's orientation.

01:02:07.182 --> 01:02:09.643
I'd really like to know
why you changed your mind.

01:02:16.316 --> 01:02:19.945
A suspended sentence means
losing your tax accountant license, right?

01:02:21.613 --> 01:02:22.739
Yes, but that's…

01:02:22.822 --> 01:02:27.535
Maybe you felt losing your license
was too steep a price for protecting him.

01:02:28.161 --> 01:02:30.246
Or maybe you did hit him

01:02:30.330 --> 01:02:33.166
but couldn't live
with your license being revoked.

01:02:33.249 --> 01:02:34.626
It must be one of the two.

01:02:42.008 --> 01:02:43.969
I tried to do the decent thing.

01:02:45.887 --> 01:02:48.473
But it cost more than I could handle.

01:02:48.556 --> 01:02:51.226
I can't accept losing
my license over this.

01:02:51.309 --> 01:02:53.103
I'm sorry.

01:02:55.814 --> 01:02:57.482
When I said my reason for appealing

01:02:58.608 --> 01:03:03.363
was just to reveal the truth,
that was an exaggeration.

01:03:07.325 --> 01:03:08.660
It wasn't an exaggeration.

01:03:09.285 --> 01:03:10.578
It was a lie.

01:03:10.662 --> 01:03:12.998
Although I'm not sure
where the lie started.

01:03:18.336 --> 01:03:19.337
Sir,

01:03:20.422 --> 01:03:22.298
you need to head to court now.

01:03:25.385 --> 01:03:26.428
We should go.

01:03:38.773 --> 01:03:41.359
You admitted everything
in the first trial,

01:03:41.443 --> 01:03:43.695
but now you're appealing
on a not guilty plea?

01:03:44.446 --> 01:03:45.697
Is that correct, counsel?

01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:46.823
Yes, it is.

01:03:47.782 --> 01:03:50.577
All right.
Please state your grounds for appeal.

01:03:54.039 --> 01:03:56.583
According to the charges
and the original ruling,

01:03:56.666 --> 01:03:59.794
this is an assault case
that started over a fee dispute

01:03:59.878 --> 01:04:02.672
between the defendant,
who's a tax accountant, and his client.

01:04:03.757 --> 01:04:05.091
But that's not what happened.

01:04:06.009 --> 01:04:08.261
There was no argument over fees,

01:04:08.344 --> 01:04:10.847
and the defendant committed
no act of assault or injury.

01:04:11.389 --> 01:04:14.642
{\an8}The original court's ruling
is based on a misreading of the facts.

01:04:14.726 --> 01:04:16.519
{\an8}PLAINTIFF

01:04:16.603 --> 01:04:20.106
In the first trial,
you admitted to all of the charges.

01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:23.318
Now you're saying
the facts are completely different?

01:04:24.027 --> 01:04:26.654
That's right.
The defendant admitted to everything

01:04:26.738 --> 01:04:28.573
to avoid making a big deal out of it.

01:04:28.656 --> 01:04:31.076
But now, he's appealing
to set the record straight.

01:04:31.159 --> 01:04:34.704
Understood. Prosecutor, your statement?

01:04:35.538 --> 01:04:37.749
Please dismiss the defendant's appeal.

01:04:38.374 --> 01:04:40.460
Okay, we will review the evidence.

01:04:40.543 --> 01:04:43.296
No objections
to the first trial's evidence?

01:04:55.934 --> 01:04:59.604
According to the victim's statement,
when asked for a discount on the fees,

01:04:59.687 --> 01:05:02.357
the defendant suddenly began
throwing objects.

01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:04.943
Why do you keep messing with me?

01:05:06.069 --> 01:05:07.862
You're going to hit someone over money?

01:05:08.488 --> 01:05:09.572
You're going to hit me?

01:05:09.656 --> 01:05:11.449
Stop talking nonsense!

01:05:16.329 --> 01:05:19.290
This is a laptop
for the visually impaired.

01:05:19.374 --> 01:05:21.709
More precisely,
it's a braille display device.

01:05:22.293 --> 01:05:24.546
Not only does each device
cost over 6 million won,

01:05:24.629 --> 01:05:29.342
but without it, the defendant would face
unimaginable difficulties in daily life.

01:05:29.425 --> 01:05:32.512
It would severely hinder his ability
to work as a tax accountant.

01:05:32.595 --> 01:05:35.431
The defendant had no reason
to throw that object himself.

01:05:36.266 --> 01:05:37.976
You can't do this to me!

01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:41.271
Hey.

01:05:41.771 --> 01:05:44.065
Hey, Kim Seungkook!

01:05:49.737 --> 01:05:50.989
DIAGNOSIS: TOTAL BLINDNESS

01:05:51.072 --> 01:05:54.868
The defendant is completely blind
and unable to perceive even light.

01:05:55.451 --> 01:05:57.954
The restroom is here. Feel free to use it.

01:05:59.539 --> 01:06:01.541
Given his condition,
it would be impossible

01:06:01.624 --> 01:06:03.793
to strike the victim's hand
that precisely.

01:06:04.586 --> 01:06:06.129
And unless we're defying gravity,

01:06:06.212 --> 01:06:08.548
simply hitting the hand
wouldn't cause the receiver

01:06:08.631 --> 01:06:12.218
to fly across the room
and hit the mirror.

01:06:15.638 --> 01:06:17.765
Hey!

01:06:19.684 --> 01:06:23.313
He took away the receiver and threw it!
The prior statement was inaccurate.

01:06:24.105 --> 01:06:25.106
Are you the victim?

01:06:25.899 --> 01:06:27.609
Mr. Kim Seungkook?

01:06:27.692 --> 01:06:28.776
Yes, that's right.

01:06:29.652 --> 01:06:32.197
You'll have a chance to speak,
so please remain silent.

01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:34.574
If you interrupt again,
I'll have you removed.

01:06:35.450 --> 01:06:37.660
- Counsel, please continue.
- Yes, Your Honor.

01:06:45.418 --> 01:06:47.670
This is the defendant's
previous home address.

01:06:49.088 --> 01:06:51.799
And it's the same as the victim's.

01:06:55.386 --> 01:06:56.471
The relationship…

01:06:58.056 --> 01:07:00.475
was beyond that
of a typical accountant and client.

01:07:00.558 --> 01:07:01.893
- No--
- Please remain seated.

01:07:01.976 --> 01:07:04.103
- No! Hold on!
- Please remain seated.

01:07:04.187 --> 01:07:05.855
- Please sit. Calm down.
- Hold on.

01:07:06.689 --> 01:07:09.525
Mr. Kim, this is your final warning.

01:07:13.112 --> 01:07:14.197
The two were…

01:07:17.242 --> 01:07:21.579
close enough to live together
as roommates.

01:07:34.550 --> 01:07:37.887
The defendant lived with the victim
and lent him money countless times.

01:07:37.971 --> 01:07:41.057
In total, the amount exceeded
80 million won, a significant sum.

01:07:42.225 --> 01:07:43.768
This case is about money.

01:07:43.851 --> 01:07:46.646
It wasn't about a service fee.
It was about unpaid loans.

01:07:46.729 --> 01:07:48.982
Why should I have to pay that back?

01:07:49.065 --> 01:07:50.483
If you keep this up…

01:07:50.566 --> 01:07:53.861
When asked for the money,
the victim was unable to repay.

01:07:53.945 --> 01:07:56.447
He decided to fake an assault
and began recording

01:07:56.531 --> 01:07:57.865
as if he were being attacked.

01:07:57.949 --> 01:07:59.742
You're going to hit someone over money?

01:07:59.826 --> 01:08:01.244
You're going to hit me?

01:08:02.370 --> 01:08:03.788
Stay still!

01:08:15.508 --> 01:08:16.801
Why are you doing this?

01:08:18.594 --> 01:08:20.221
Stop it!

01:08:20.763 --> 01:08:21.889
Please don't…

01:08:23.391 --> 01:08:24.684
However, the original trial

01:08:24.767 --> 01:08:27.145
found the defendant guilty
of injuring the victim.

01:08:27.228 --> 01:08:29.772
This ruling misinterpreted the facts.

01:08:29.856 --> 01:08:31.733
We ask the court to overturn the verdict

01:08:31.816 --> 01:08:34.027
and find the defendant not guilty.

01:08:38.531 --> 01:08:39.532
Mr. Kim,

01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:43.328
you may speak now.
Do you have anything to say?

01:08:50.209 --> 01:08:51.210
No, I don't.

01:09:16.652 --> 01:09:18.821
Okay, I'll head out now.

01:09:21.866 --> 01:09:24.160
Thank you for believing me.

01:09:30.291 --> 01:09:31.376
I never did.

01:09:32.877 --> 01:09:36.964
All I did was build the strongest case
I could from the evidence.

01:09:37.048 --> 01:09:39.675
Still, what you uncovered…

01:09:40.176 --> 01:09:41.928
- It is the truth.
- Who knows?

01:09:43.179 --> 01:09:46.849
Maybe I uncovered the real truth,
or maybe it's just a convincing lie.

01:09:47.517 --> 01:09:49.143
Only you would know that.

01:09:53.731 --> 01:09:54.732
And…

01:09:55.566 --> 01:09:58.152
Thank you for being considerate
to Seungkook.

01:09:59.904 --> 01:10:02.532
I was able to make my argument
without saying anyway.

01:10:02.615 --> 01:10:04.492
This is as far as my job goes.

01:10:05.076 --> 01:10:06.703
The verdict is for you.

01:10:07.578 --> 01:10:09.956
That's why we don't attend hearings.

01:10:11.249 --> 01:10:12.250
I'll get going now.

01:10:46.617 --> 01:10:49.120
HOLDING, REASONING

01:10:55.793 --> 01:10:57.128
Gosh.

01:10:59.464 --> 01:11:03.426
FACT CHECK BY NEXT WEEK

01:11:08.639 --> 01:11:11.309
{\an8}SPECIAL HANDOVER NOTES

01:11:26.699 --> 01:11:28.993
Such a small world.

01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:36.083
ASK AHN JUHYEONG FOR DIFFICULT CASES

01:11:38.127 --> 01:11:40.087
It seems you've become a good lawyer.

01:11:54.602 --> 01:11:56.938
Let's go! Move it!

01:11:57.021 --> 01:11:59.148
You scared me. You should knock.

01:12:01.317 --> 01:12:03.194
Let's go! Move it!

01:12:03.277 --> 01:12:05.571
Hold on. I need to dry my hair.

01:12:05.655 --> 01:12:09.450
Hurry up! Your hair will dry on its own.
Hurry up, come on!

01:12:09.534 --> 01:12:11.244
It's winter. I'll catch a cold.

01:12:12.245 --> 01:12:15.248
Do they have no concept of time
or no concept of etiquette?

01:12:15.331 --> 01:12:17.166
- We're here!
- Hey.

01:12:17.708 --> 01:12:18.709
What?

01:12:19.752 --> 01:12:20.878
What's going on?

01:12:20.962 --> 01:12:22.046
Where's the new guest?

01:12:22.129 --> 01:12:24.674
She had things to sort out.
She'll meet us there.

01:12:24.757 --> 01:12:25.800
Is that so?

01:12:27.468 --> 01:12:29.428
What's with your face? Are you hungry?

01:12:29.512 --> 01:12:31.556
- No.
- Hurry. Juhyeong's hungry.

01:12:32.265 --> 01:12:34.725
- I'm not.
- I'm going as fast as I can go.

01:12:35.393 --> 01:12:37.645
- Are you hungry?
- I said I wasn't!

01:12:47.572 --> 01:12:48.573
Pretty.

01:12:51.033 --> 01:12:54.287
We'll have three glasses of beer,
one grilled chicken,

01:12:54.370 --> 01:12:56.414
- and sausage fries, please.
- Okay.

01:12:56.497 --> 01:12:59.208
You were hungry, right?
We'll have a pepperoni pizza too.

01:12:59.292 --> 01:13:00.877
- Okay.
- Fine, I'm hungry.

01:13:02.670 --> 01:13:03.671
That was quick.

01:13:03.754 --> 01:13:06.591
- Another glass, please!
- We'll get one more.

01:13:07.133 --> 01:13:09.594
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:13:09.677 --> 01:13:12.054
- You haven't even started yet?
- We just got here.

01:13:12.138 --> 01:13:14.181
Why did you have to order three dishes?

01:13:14.265 --> 01:13:15.641
You'll eat them all anyways.

01:13:15.725 --> 01:13:17.184
You didn't order what I wanted.

01:13:17.268 --> 01:13:19.228
We could've ordered just two
with the beer.

01:13:19.312 --> 01:13:20.396
You're arguing already?

01:13:20.479 --> 01:13:22.064
- She's wasting money…
- Thank you.

01:13:24.609 --> 01:13:26.903
- I seriously don't understand Munjeong.
- Thank you.

01:13:27.528 --> 01:13:28.779
Big cheers.

01:13:28.863 --> 01:13:30.531
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

01:13:30.615 --> 01:13:31.699
Cheers!

01:13:41.834 --> 01:13:43.044
What's wrong with him?

01:13:43.127 --> 01:13:44.128
He's hungry.

01:13:44.754 --> 01:13:45.755
I see.

01:15:04.709 --> 01:15:05.710
Bottoms up!

01:15:18.973 --> 01:15:20.933
- I think it's her.
- You're right.

01:15:21.642 --> 01:15:22.685
Over here!

01:15:33.154 --> 01:15:34.155
Wait.

01:16:13.069 --> 01:16:20.034
{\an8}Law and The City

01:16:50.731 --> 01:16:54.443
Law and The City

01:16:54.527 --> 01:16:56.153
{\an8}We were briefly together before.

01:16:57.947 --> 01:16:59.532
{\an8}- Hong Kong?
- My gosh!

01:17:00.407 --> 01:17:02.326
{\an8}- Do you know me?
- He doesn't remember me?

01:17:03.369 --> 01:17:06.914
{\an8}It's the same as mine.
Tracking someone down over unpaid loans.

01:17:06.997 --> 01:17:09.083
{\an8}Well, we saw
and we were uncomfortable. Happy?

01:17:09.166 --> 01:17:12.670
{\an8}It's totally different. I file lawsuits
and don't chase people to their homes.

01:17:12.753 --> 01:17:14.338
{\an8}You call yourself a lawyer?

01:17:14.421 --> 01:17:15.714
{\an8}Law Group Hyungmin.

01:17:17.091 --> 01:17:19.677
{\an8}- Would you like to merge?
- You think I'm the bad guy.

01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:21.720
{\an8}You wonder why I took this case.

01:17:21.804 --> 01:17:24.890
{\an8}- You should at least feel uneasy about it.
- Hey, stop it.

01:17:24.974 --> 01:17:27.768
{\an8}- What does she know?
- So he's not insane? He's just a jerk?

01:17:35.276 --> 01:17:37.278
